# Prompt log

HW4 asks for a log of the AI tools and models used and the prompts given. This project was built with **Claude Code** (Claude Opus 5.5, with Claude Fable 5.1 for the redesign review and the rewritten prompts) from Thursday evening, September 25, to Sunday, September 27, 2026, from an original design written September 24–25 ([docs/original-spec](https://github.com/bcollier/ignatius-hw4-api/tree/main/docs/original-spec)). Below is **every prompt** the author typed, 252 in all, in order and word for word (typos kept), each with a line on what was done in response. Attached screenshots are marked in italics or `[screenshot]`. No secret keys were ever typed into a prompt; a signed Storage token inside one pasted URL is redacted, and one long, personal "About me" the author pasted (prompt 184) is described rather than reproduced.

**How it was built, in phases** (details in the [frontend README](https://github.com/bcollier/ignatius-hw4-web#the-method-spec-driven-in-phases)): spec first; building to the spec; a large spec-driven revision from [IMPROVEMENTS.md](https://github.com/bcollier/ignatius-hw4-api/blob/main/docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md); a Clean Code cleanup ([CODE_CLEANUP.md](https://github.com/bcollier/ignatius-hw4-api/blob/main/docs/CODE_CLEANUP.md)); the prompts rewritten from a brief; a visual redesign from approved mockups ([VISUAL_REDESIGN.md](https://github.com/bcollier/ignatius-hw4-api/blob/main/docs/VISUAL_REDESIGN.md)); then new features (guided practices, the Examen, retreats from an idea or a photo) and testing on a real iPhone, where each problem seen on the phone came back as a prompt here. The last prompts are documentation, a security review ([CODE_REVIEW.md](https://github.com/bcollier/ignatius-hw4-api/blob/main/docs/CODE_REVIEW.md) holds the review checklist), the sign-in email, and the portfolio entry.

The same log is in both repositories: [API](https://github.com/bcollier/ignatius-hw4-api/blob/main/PROMPT_LOG.md) and [web](https://github.com/bcollier/ignatius-hw4-web/blob/main/PROMPT_LOG.md).

## Every prompt, in order

### 1. 2026-09-25, 20:56 UTC

> pull the repo at  https://github.com/bcollier/ignatius-at-home

**What was done:** Cloned the original design repo (the first iOS-app design notes) to use as a reference.

### 2. 2026-09-25, 21:00 UTC

> I can only remote control one session per machine?

**What was done:** Explained Remote Control sessions (one per machine).

### 3. 2026-09-25, 21:03 UTC

> can we move the remote to this terminal now

**What was done:** Explained how to move Remote Control to a different terminal.

### 4. 2026-09-25, 21:04 UTC

> i am running a separate terminal, how would i add this session back to remove now?

**What was done:** Walked through re-attaching this session to Remote Control.

### 5. 2026-09-25, 21:09 UTC

> to get this project started I am going to use it as a submissino for homework 4 in this course https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~113/hw4.html where we make server side code on render.com. walk me through step by step setting up the backend server with a web front end where we take a PDF exercise / reading and build three audio files, (1) the straight reading of the exercise (2) the heart focused reflection and (3) the deep dive on theology, history, and hermenoutics of the passage. this homework does not have to follow the build path in this initial design, but use it where helpful

**What was done:** Read the HW4 page and planned the backend (FastAPI on Render) and a static web front end; the first version made three MP3s per day.

### 6. 2026-09-25, 21:13 UTC

> ok do you ahve the elevenlabs key available to you?
>
> I have a lot of credits on openrouter, but I like the built in web tools etc for search and analysis with Claude, can i use my openrouter key but all the modern tooling for claude somehow?

**What was done:** Chose the Anthropic Python SDK pointed at OpenRouter's Anthropic-compatible endpoint, which keeps Claude's web search tool, structured output and prompt caching; keys go in `.env` and on Render, never in chat or git.

### 7. 2026-09-25, 21:16 UTC

> explain the copyright thing, I can't actually have a voice read this scripture since the original text of that version of teh bible is under copyright?

**What was done:** Explained why a copyrighted translation (NASB, Jerusalem Bible) can't go in a public demo; the demo uses the public-domain World English Bible.

### 8. 2026-09-25, 21:21 UTC

> could a simple AI extract the images from these PDFs?

**What was done:** Added PDF image extraction with PyMuPDF (embedded images, plus page scans for the model).

### 9. 2026-09-25, 21:26 UTC

> ok, I think I want to change the design of this, how about the app is more like "build a practice", and the user uploads a PDF or word doc that they have rights to (for my private use I would upload the bridges PDF) and my app will turn in that text and any images into a "retreat". so if they upload a PDF with seven days it does exactly what is described. if they upload a PDF that just has 7 random verses and some images it will build a 7 day retreat out of the source material. the user is in charge of content, and thereby we don't have to worry about copyright stuff. for demo purposes I will show a public domain image and public domain scripture PDFs does that work? that way I can build it to work for me, but others can do what they want with it

**What was done:** Redesigned around 'build a practice': the user uploads material they have rights to, and the planner either follows the document's days or composes a retreat from it.

### 10. 2026-09-25, 21:29 UTC

> can we do a free version with free microsoft tts or a low cost version as well? I will add money to my elevenlabs key so we can at least do a few days to see what it sounds like

**What was done:** Added free (Microsoft neural voices via edge-tts) and premium (ElevenLabs) voice tiers.

### 11. 2026-09-25, 21:30 UTC

> so every day would be its own mp3? is mp3 the right format or m4a ?

**What was done:** Kept MP3 (plays everywhere on the web); M4A noted for a future native app.

### 12. 2026-09-25, 21:31 UTC

> ok, build the homework 5 spec then as we discussed

**What was done:** Wrote the build spec and built the first full version.

### 13. 2026-09-25, 21:31 UTC

> do you need my openrouter key?

**What was done:** Explained that the key goes in `.env` and on Render, not in chat.

### 14. 2026-09-25, 21:39 UTC

> on the web page the prompts should be customizable, also the images should not be described with words but rather shown on the page. for a front end we can use vercel for the player if that is more versetile than github pages

**What was done:** Made every prompt editable on the page (with a fixed server-side suffix) and showed the images themselves.

### 15. 2026-09-25, 21:42 UTC

> the app should have a login so users can upload the materials on their laptop and then play the audio from phone web browser

**What was done:** Added sign-in so a retreat made on a laptop plays on a phone.

### 16. 2026-09-25, 21:43 UTC

> can you build in sound? how will you handle the pause and reflect?

**What was done:** Built the prayer player: a lectio sequence with bells and timed silences, played as real audio so it continues on a locked phone.

### 17. 2026-09-25, 21:51 UTC

> supabase

**What was done:** Chose Supabase: Auth (email links), a `retreats` table and a private Storage bucket.

### 18. 2026-09-26, 04:45 UTC

> Create and push GitHub repos

**What was done:** Created and pushed the two GitHub repos (API and web).

### 19. 2026-09-26, 04:58 UTC

> I’ve. Got the supabase key

**What was done:** Set up the Supabase keys (the secret key only on the server).

### 20. 2026-09-26, 04:59 UTC

> No

**What was done:** Continued setup without the step the user declined.

### 21. 2026-09-26, 15:22 UTC

> https://github.com/bcollier/supabase-demos give me terminal code to add the supabase secrets etc

**What was done:** Gave terminal steps for the Supabase secrets, matched to the user's earlier demo repo.

### 22. 2026-09-26, 15:24 UTC

> I really need simpler instructions, how do I edit a text file in terminal for example, last time I had to lookup a bunch of vim commands, is there an easier way, walk me through step by step

**What was done:** Gave simple editing instructions (`nano`, or TextEdit with `open -e`) instead of vim.

### 23. 2026-09-26, 15:26 UTC

> I'm on my laptop, this code is on my mac mini so the mac text editor line didn't work

**What was done:** Explained editing files on the Mac mini from the laptop.

### 24. 2026-09-26, 15:35 UTC

> [screenshot]
> I added the secrets to .env, I setup supabase, now I created a render account but I don't see blueprints

**What was done:** Walked through Render's Blueprint (render.yaml) setup.

### 25. 2026-09-26, 15:37 UTC

> [screenshot]

**What was done:** Looked at the Blueprint screen for the web repo; the web app went to GitHub Pages instead.

### 26. 2026-09-26, 15:41 UTC

> https://ignatius-hw4-api.onrender.com

**What was done:** Connected the web page to the deployed API.

### 27. 2026-09-26, 15:53 UTC

> [screenshot]
> the image doesn't seem to work https://ignatius-hw4-api.onrender.comhttps//fgvwkrdmjqitupafrzjm.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/sign/retreats/7423e07a-dff6-4020-885e-236b08edcd28/bc609f06-4e84-491f-a2c9-7d9a54ae165b/image0.jpg?token=[redacted]

**What was done:** Fixed image URLs: the page was prefixing the API address onto already-absolute signed Storage URLs (added `fileUrl()`). The signed token is redacted here.

### 28. 2026-09-26, 15:56 UTC

> how long does the browser stay signed in with these links?

**What was done:** Explained sign-in session length (Supabase refresh tokens keep the browser signed in) and signed URL lifetimes (24 h, cached 23 h).

### 29. 2026-09-26, 15:59 UTC

> [screenshot]
> I clicked pray this day but I can't click the play button https://bcollier.github.io/ignatius-hw4-web/?r=bc609f06-4e84-491f-a2c9-7d9a54ae165b#

**What was done:** Fixed the play button (a stale cached app.js) and added `?v=N` cache-busting on every asset.

### 30. 2026-09-26, 16:07 UTC

> you stuck?

**What was done:** Finished the fix and reported.

### 31. 2026-09-26, 16:09 UTC

> [screenshot]
> looks like it is working now

**What was done:** Confirmed it works.

### 32. 2026-09-26, 16:17 UTC

> I want to see how long the combined set is going to be. I also want the start to give instructions to Ask for the grace to hear Christ calling me by name and to come to him just as I am, carrying whatever burdens me. , or as for whatever grace for that day, then give 10-20 seconds or so, then give instructions similar to ignatius examine. "as we read the reading for the day four times, on this first reading focus on ...."
>
> I want to be able to change the voice for each section. there should be a 5 second pause or so between sections, it runs together now

**What was done:** Added total length, spoken guidance (ask for the grace, silence, 'on this first reading, focus on…'), a voice per section and 5-second gaps.

### 33. 2026-09-26, 16:22 UTC

> I want to be able to choose the model, and I want to show estimated costs for both the elevenlabs production and the model calls

**What was done:** Added a model menu with live OpenRouter prices, cost estimates before each build and actual costs after.

### 34. 2026-09-26, 16:28 UTC

> I want a complete visual diagram of how the app works, including ERD diagrams of the database, user flow diagrams for sign in, how the service is hosted on render and supabase, how all the API calls work, etc. documentation should be extensive

**What was done:** Wrote docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: system, hosting, sign-in, a sequence diagram for every API call, ERD and more, all in Mermaid.

### 35. 2026-09-26, 16:32 UTC

> also, how will users test this if the only allowed email address is me? can we have a free mode where we use a model I have academic access to on Jetstream so add one more key, they have llama 4 scout and a muse model from meta

**What was done:** Added free mode on Jetstream (Muse Glimmer and Llama 4 Scout) with a `JETSTREAM_API_KEY`.

### 36. 2026-09-26, 16:40 UTC

> where is .env

**What was done:** Explained where `.env` lives (`~/Code/ignatius-hw4-api/.env`, gitignored).

### 37. 2026-09-26, 16:43 UTC

> ok I put the key in both places, and hit rebuild on render

**What was done:** Confirmed the redeploy picked up the key.

### 38. 2026-09-26, 16:46 UTC

> how about any user can sign in and make an account etc. but only select users get the premium features? I just now enabled anonymoius sign ins how will that work will they have an account that can move from desktop to iphone

**What was done:** Opened sign-in to everyone (including guest sign-in that upgrades to an email account); premium models and voices only for `ALLOWED_EMAILS`.

### 39. 2026-09-26, 16:48 UTC

> can I give you a key to tavily so we can enable web search in free mode?

**What was done:** Added Tavily web research for free mode (server-side search, since Jetstream models can't search).

### 40. 2026-09-26, 16:50 UTC

> I want the tool to be able to build a PDF with the whole script together so users can follow along with a printed version or someting on their ipad

**What was done:** Added the printable script PDF (whole retreat or one day), built with PyMuPDF Story.

### 41. 2026-09-26, 16:52 UTC

> I want a log table on supabase so we can see every call made to an llm and the response, log it by user

**What was done:** Added the `llm_calls` log table and `llm_usage_by_user` view; every model call and response is logged by user.

### 42. 2026-09-26, 17:03 UTC

> ok its setup in supabase. three more additions, I created accounts for exa and brave search. For the free version I want to add exa, brave search - Search, and brave search - Answers. brave search has two different API's and two different API keys

**What was done:** Added Exa, Brave Search and Brave Answers (separate keys).

### 43. 2026-09-26, 17:08 UTC

> one more, I also added the free tier for firecrawl, it has its own API key. add that to the list. these should all have wrapping aroud them that safely drops them from the proces if we hit the credit limit for the month. if these search things blow up it should be robost. results from tavily, brave search, exa, and firecrawl should all be logged in the table.

**What was done:** Added Firecrawl, and wrapped every service so a credit limit pauses it until next month, a rate limit for a minute and a bad key for an hour; all results logged.

### 44. 2026-09-26, 17:12 UTC

> ok, last one just for completion sake, I added linkup for deep research or search, wire this one in to, faily nicely when the credits run out

**What was done:** Added Linkup search and Linkup deep research, failing gracefully when credits run out.

### 45. 2026-09-26, 17:21 UTC

> ok keys are in

**What was done:** Verified all seven research services with real keys (rows logged in `llm_calls`).

### 46. 2026-09-26, 17:23 UTC

> is muse superior in every way to llama 4 scout

**What was done:** Compared Muse Glimmer and Llama 4 Scout (Muse is the stronger writer and reads images; Scout is faster).

### 47. 2026-09-26, 17:24 UTC

> use muse for everything, it works with images as well. speed is not an issue

**What was done:** Made Muse the model for everything in free mode, including images.

### 48. 2026-09-26, 17:25 UTC

> allow the user to select llama 4 scout or muse, but default to muse

**What was done:** Let users pick Llama 4 Scout or Muse, defaulting to Muse.

### 49. 2026-09-26, 17:31 UTC

> sure change wording

**What was done:** Changed the wording as suggested.

### 50. 2026-09-26, 17:33 UTC

> [screenshot of the retreat page: "Planning failed: Planning was interrupted by a server restart"]

**What was done:** Fixed 'Planning was interrupted by a server restart': jobs now keep a heartbeat and resume automatically after a redeploy.

### 51. 2026-09-26, 17:36 UTC

> on more feature request, there should be a "this retreat is part of a series" and allow the user to select previous retreats. we then send the model all the materials (reading, heart, deep dive, for every day) from all the previous retreat so it incorporates the series as when it is building this week's retreat. if someone is doing a 9 month retreat week by week they should be able to use this.

**What was done:** Added series: a retreat can follow earlier weeks, and the model gets every earlier week's readings, reflections and deep dives.

### 52. 2026-09-26, 17:41 UTC

> remove the 3 retreat limit

**What was done:** Removed the three-retreat limit for free accounts.

### 53. 2026-09-26, 17:45 UTC

> switching to fable to ask, what would make this app as we have it so far better? review how it works visually, and in terms of flow, and design changes that would take less than 3-4 hours that could take this app to the next level. when I say 3-4 hours I mean of claude code time, not human time. I am willing to let claude run for an extended goal with a detailed improvement spec.

**What was done:** Reviewed the app visually and in flow with Claude Fable and wrote docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md, a redesign spec.

### 54. 2026-09-26, 17:48 UTC

> [screenshot]
> don't offer the PDF if if the reflection and deep dive haven't been written

**What was done:** Hid the PDF button until the reflection and deep dive are written.

### 55. 2026-09-26, 17:50 UTC

> I don't like how there is two build stages, (build retreat, then make all the audio and text). just give me all the options at once and push go and it should all be made. there should be tabs for simple mode/autopilot, and then an advanced optionss where you set the silence times, customize prompts, set the voices, etc. but it should be upload a pdf and push go and have an easy time

**What was done:** Made it one step: upload and 'Make my retreat', with Simple and Advanced tabs holding every option.

### 56. 2026-09-26, 17:54 UTC

> on more change it should track which audio has been played. if I miss a day I want to remember and know if i played the audio already. during the prayer while things are playing it should display images from the day if there are any images associated with that day. for the iphone version it should be a small player at the bottom and most of the screen should be the image.

**What was done:** Added listening progress and missed days, and a full-screen image during prayer with a small docked player on phones.

### 57. 2026-09-26, 17:55 UTC

> put tier 1 and 2 together in the spec, do both

**What was done:** Merged tiers 1 and 2 of the spec and built both.

### 58. 2026-09-26, 17:56 UTC

> you have use of my computer to run free builds as much as needed to continually test and improve the app, not once at the end. while you build feel free to test

**What was done:** Saved a standing permission to run free builds (Jetstream, edge-tts, local server, Chrome) while building, and tested throughout.

### 59. 2026-09-26, 17:58 UTC

> make sure the different parts of the retreat know about each other, for example the "spoken guidance" should know what was given to the user in the "heart" section

**What was done:** Wrote the parts in listening order: the heart, then the deep dive with the heart in context, then guidance tailored to both.

### 60. 2026-09-26, 18:00 UTC

> make sure the architecture.md is featured prominantly on both README files of the API and the web github

**What was done:** Featured docs/ARCHITECTURE.md at the top of both READMEs.

### 61. 2026-09-26, 18:02 UTC

> links and background information on what the ignatius exercises are, what a retreat is, and what is lectio devina. Revise the prompts for all models for detailed description of the exercises, and lectio divina so they konw more context if needed

**What was done:** Added the About page with links, and a detailed background on the Exercises, retreats and lectio divina sent to every model.

### 62. 2026-09-26, 18:05 UTC

> can we run a spiritual direction conversation with OpenAI live 1 through a web browser? the conversation should have a prompt about spiritual directi onand prayer companionship, and context as to which retreat days the user has listened to. the script should be asking questions, then probing, giving very little advice mostly focusing on helping the retreatant notice where god is at work and helping them engage with the retreat. I can paste an OpenAI key if needed, but running through OpenRouter would be better if that is technically possble. add this to the current revisions being work on since I will not return for several hours.

**What was done:** Built 'Talk it over': a live voice conversation (OpenAI GPT-Live over WebRTC) modeled on how spiritual directors listen, aware of the retreat.

### 63. 2026-09-26, 18:06 UTC

> the spiritual direction live 1 voice should be for premium users only, or limit free users to one minute of conversation

**What was done:** Made live conversation premium, with one free minute a day for everyone else.

### 64. 2026-09-26, 18:13 UTC

> for spiritual direction add grok voice as an option. users should be able to choose in advanced setting which voice provider and which voice they want to talk to. you should also be able to upload a text. word or PDF document about yourself for spiritual direction and retreat building. the "user info.md" saved file should inform everything in the retreat building, spiritual directoin, etc. if the user uploads too much have a model condense down the user information to a managable size but warn the user it is using a summarized version of their notes about themselves. user could also notes particular things they are looking for in the companion piece of spiritual direction. do not call anything spiritual direction, i'm just using that as a metaphor, but people would be pissed if I actually thought I had made an AI spiritual companion. but in reality, the ai talking bot should be modeled after the guidance given to spiritual directors. add all of this to the current build

**What was done:** Added xAI Grok voice as a second provider with a choice of voice; added About me (`user info.md`, typed or uploaded, condensed with a warning when long) used by every model call; nothing in the app is called 'spiritual direction'.

### 65. 2026-09-26, 18:17 UTC

> do not stop building until everything in the revision spec is done plus evertything I have added. add my recent comments to the revision spec

**What was done:** Kept building through the whole spec and added these requests to it (section 10).

### 66. 2026-09-26, 18:18 UTC

> all chat history with the spiritual director should be saved to supabase so it remembers past conversations

**What was done:** Saved conversation history to Supabase; the companion remembers (the recent ones in full, older ones as a summary).

### 67. 2026-09-26, 18:19 UTC

> spiritual director should also know which days the user has listened since htier last conversation and how many days have passed since htier last conversation, and whether it is currently night or day, etc. so they seem like a reasonably aware companion

**What was done:** Gave the companion what's new since the last talk (days listened or prayed, days since) and the local time of day.

### 68. 2026-09-26, 18:28 UTC

> costs should not be on the iphone version, they should be displayed when building the retreat but not when playing through them

**What was done:** Showed costs only while a retreat is being made, and never on phones.

### 69. 2026-09-26, 18:34 UTC

> at first login users should have an example retreat that we have already made using the demo PDF or similar. we should also have a premium demo retreat that is recorded with premium models (Fable) and elevenlabs. to clarify, these should be already built and they just listen to them, they don't get to build something with premium models. for our demo retreat make sure you put an image for each day so the demo looks really cool. use a lot of thinking and fable if needed to build the demo retreat package with verses, prayer for graces, and high resolution publicly available images that are striking and beautiful to accompnay the text. add all this to the design.
>
> add every prompt I have given you so far to the prompts_log .md to comply with this assignment. push the prompt history to both repos
>
> the web readme pages should be complete with beautiful screenshots from the demo on iphone

**What was done:** Built the 'Come and See' demo package (seven Gospel encounters, WEB text, a public-domain painting for each day) and two example retreats (free: Muse and Microsoft voices; premium: Claude Fable 5.1 and ElevenLabs) that everyone sees at first login, read only; this log; iPhone screenshots for the READMEs.

### 70. 2026-09-26, 18:38 UTC

> [screenshot]
> I added a subscription to elevenlabs and $20 so you can build the demo wtih elevenlabs voices

**What was done:** Built the premium example entirely with ElevenLabs voices.

### 71. 2026-09-26, 18:40 UTC

> why only one research site, for the free version I assumed you would still use all four free search engines like tavily exo and others

**What was done:** Changed free-mode research to ask every search service at once ('All services, combined', now the default) and interleave their results.

### 72. 2026-09-26, 18:42 UTC

> somewhere in the app put a page of "research done for this retreat" that has the links and resources found by each day and all the raw sources so you can easily see how it built the materials for the day. this is more for the desktop version under an advanced setting rather than showing it to users all the time.

**What was done:** Saved each day's research (searches, every result with the service that found it, which were cited) and added a desktop-only Research page, turned on under Advanced.

### 73. 2026-09-26, 18:45 UTC

> build a much bigger and more robust readme for especially the web frontend, it should describe the purpose, resources used, screenshots, design choices, and go on nearly forever in details about building this app. the back end readme should have some of the visuals from teh architecture.md file to give a system overview and again be much more robust, like crazy detailed about this project.

**What was done:** Rewrote both READMEs at length, with system diagrams in the API README and screenshots in the web README.

### 74. 2026-09-26, 18:47 UTC

> in the front end, give blurbs about each of the free search providers, their strengths and weaknesses, and details all about the voice providers, especially why someone my want to use the premium voices. if possible let users play a small audio sample of some voices through the github readme page to compare the providers. again be just super detailed about everything imaginable that went into this app including a description of ignatian spirituallity and retreats etc.

**What was done:** Recorded samples of all twelve voices, and described every voice and research service on the About page and in the web README.

### 75. 2026-09-26, 18:51 UTC

> what should we call the grok api key?

**What was done:** Named it `XAI_API_KEY` (with `OPENAI_API_KEY` for GPT-Live), to go in `.env` and on Render.

### 76. 2026-09-26, 18:51 UTC

> I have it when you're ready

**What was done:** Walked through adding the key to `.env` locally and in Render's Environment tab.

### 77. 2026-09-26, 18:55 UTC

> i added XAI and openai api keys for both local and render

**What was done:** Confirmed both keys were picked up; Talk it over is enabled with OpenAI and Grok.

### 78. 2026-09-26, 18:57 UTC

> for the premium version we are adding in the search from all the free services also correct? this could save us on search money for anthropic, make sure we use free serach for both and anthropic can do additional search on its own

**What was done:** Yes: Claude models now also get the combined free-service results first, as a head start, before their own web search.

### 79. 2026-09-26, 18:58 UTC

> I still want the anthropic search to be robust and exhaustive wherever possible. I like these deep insights from anthropic, and if we get poor search from the other providers i don't want that to be a limit

**What was done:** Kept Claude's own web search at its full allowance (up to 5 searches) and told it not to be limited by the free results, only to use them as a start. Also found the premium example's ElevenLabs failures were the concurrent-request limit, not credits: recording now uses at most 2 ElevenLabs requests at once with 429 retries, and a new "Try again" path (`POST /days/{n}/retry`, `tools/retry_days.py`) re-records only the failed clips from the saved scripts.

### 80. 2026-09-26, 19:00 UTC

> add all my prompts to the prompt log

**What was done:** Added every prompt, including these, to this log in both repositories.

### 81. 2026-09-26, 19:02 UTC

> i don't see a user table in supabase *(with a screenshot of the ER diagram and the Table Editor)*

**What was done:** Explained that accounts live in Supabase Auth's own `auth.users` table (the `auth` schema, or Authentication → Users), which the Table Editor hides by default, and added that note under both ER diagrams. The screenshot run also found that the API's CORS settings didn't allow `PATCH`, so changing a start date failed from the live site; fixed.

### 82. 2026-09-26, 19:11 UTC

> right now the sign in email comes from supabase, is there a way to customize this so users know it is for the retreat app *(with a screenshot of the default "Confirm your email address" email)*

**What was done:** Wrote branded subjects and bodies for the Confirm signup, Magic Link and Change Email Address templates, and explained that the sender name and "powered by Supabase" footer need custom SMTP.

### 83. 2026-09-26, 19:14 UTC

> *(screenshot of Supabase's Emails page: "Set up custom SMTP to edit templates")*

**What was done:** Corrected the earlier answer: Supabase now requires custom SMTP before templates can be edited. Gave step-by-step setup with Resend on the collier.phd domain (host smtp.resend.com, port 465, user resend, API key as password), a Gmail app-password alternative, and raising the email rate limit.

### 84. 2026-09-26, 19:24 UTC

> ok, mark the smtp thing as a todo item, I don't have time now

**What was done:** Added a "To do" section to docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md with the SMTP steps. Saved the three branded templates in docs/email-templates.md so they're ready to paste.

### 85. 2026-09-26, 19:27 UTC

> my premium user page look not as good as teh new user, where are the example guides *(with a screenshot of the library signed in as ben@collier.phd)*

**What was done:** The examples were built under Ben's account, so they were listed as his own retreats, with a Delete link that would have removed them for everyone. Examples are now always listed as examples, even for the account that built them, and can't be deleted from the site. Your own retreats now show a cover painting, and a single retreat is one clean card.

### 86. 2026-09-26, 19:30 UTC

> *(screenshot of the sign-in page: "Couldn't send the link: email rate limit exceeded")*

**What was done:** Explained that Supabase's built-in sender allows only a couple of sign-in emails an hour (fixed by the SMTP to-do). The sign-in page now says so plainly and points to "Try it without an account".

### 87. 2026-09-26, 19:34 UTC

> somehow the text should still be available to be shown on screen, right now it is only the image, maybe have options to do image, scripture, or scripture + image? if possible there should be an animation that hovers over each word in the reading as it is being spoken etc. if not we can skip the animatino

**What was done:** Added Image and text, Image only and Text only views on the prayer screen, with the spoken word highlighted and kept in view. New recordings save exact word timings from both voice services; older ones estimate the position.

### 88. 2026-09-26, 19:36 UTC

> how do i see the cost to produce the retreat? what was the total cost breakdown for the example?

**What was done:** Gave the premium example's breakdown: about $0.47 planning, $6.71 writing (the deep dives with web search were $5.57 of it) and 46,245 ElevenLabs characters (about $13.87 at list price), about $21 in all. The free example cost $0.15 (Exa searches). Added a "What it cost to make" section to finished retreats on a computer, and fixed "Try again" resetting a day's writing cost.

### 89. 2026-09-26, 19:41 UTC

> the deep dive  and heart reflection prompt doesn't say anythign about how this could be part of a larger retreat. that should somehow be in the text since we are passing past days text and they don't ahve to explain something they just explained yesterday. they can comment on how this relates to something yesterday, or even upcoming readings (give them just the readings for the future days, not the analysis)

**What was done:** The heart and deep writers now get the earlier days' reflections and deep dives (newest first) and the coming days' readings only, with instructions not to re-explain, to connect back where it helps, and not to preview what's ahead.

### 90. 2026-09-26, 19:42 UTC

> give details for the conversation voices as to what they sounds like *(with screenshots of the OpenAI and Grok voice pickers)*

**What was done:** Recorded a sample of all 28 xAI voices and OpenAI's Marin and Cedar (the only two of OpenAI's live voices it offers outside live conversation). Added a "▶ Hear this voice" button and each voice's gender to the picker, a player grid on the About page, and a table of samples in the web README.

### 91. 2026-09-26, 19:46 UTC

> i don't like how this show research option is handled, users should be able to show reserach anytime, not just decide once when building the retreat. put in a way for users typically on web to show the research on a page, either in settings turned on or on a tucked away show reserach notes link that goes to the details. *(with a screenshot of the Advanced models section)*

**What was done:** Removed the checkbox. On a computer, each day now has a "Research notes" link next to the printable script, and the retreat page has "Research notes for this retreat" at its foot; both are hidden on phones. The research service picker now shows for Claude models too, since they get the free results first.

### 92. 2026-09-26, 19:53 UTC

> link to the About me when you say what you've told it about yourself in the talk it over.
>
> how do I change the "talk it over" voice after generating the retreat, for some reason teh voice options fro talk it over are stuck in the generate retreat menu. bury these somewhere, but I hould be able to change anytime

**What was done:** Linked "what you've told it about yourself" to About me. Moved the voice service and voice picker from the new-retreat form to the Talk it over page, under a "Change voice" link, usable any time with the "▶ Hear this voice" samples. A voice changed there is used for the very next conversation.

### 93. 2026-09-26, 19:54 UTC

> for the brown circle, I want an animation playing when it is hearing me talk or when it is talking . something glowing or bouncing similar to how chatgpt does voice mode *(with a screenshot of a live conversation)*

**What was done:** The orb now follows the actual sound through Web Audio analysers: it swells in a pale tone with your microphone, glows warm with a slow shimmer while the companion speaks (OpenAI's WebRTC track or Grok's audio), and breathes slowly in between. Reduced-motion settings get the glow without movement.

### 94. 2026-09-26, 19:59 UTC

> I don't want costs shown in the regular app, there should be a settings or log page tucked away somewhere that just says how much each retreat costs broken down by section/vendor. *(with a screenshot of the New retreat page showing "About $4.24 for a seven-day retreat")*

**What was done:** Removed every cost from the regular app (the estimate, prices in the model menus, the ElevenLabs balance, the cost section on a retreat). Added a Costs page reached from a small footer link: each retreat by part and by company, a total by company, calls not tied to a retreat, and the prices used. It's built from a new `GET /api/costs` that adds up the llm_calls log and the recorded voices.

### 95. 2026-09-26, 20:08 UTC

> there should be an option when making a retreat something like "watch the technical details of this retreat being built" and it should have a box that look slike a terminal window or something that shows you the details of every call to an API, what the response is, and what the next step in the process is as the build is happening live. this call/response API log should be stored in a sql table when complete  if it is not already along with the retreat so we can follow every step and in theory recreate it in the future if needed. the new retreat page should allow users to build a retreat using an example PDF. so below where it would be uploaded say use an example. make this example PDF different than the two examples that are already made. make them look very premium with verses and images etc., store them on the server. a user should be able to build the retreat and get a sense of the process (also look at the source PDF) so they can understand how to make a retreat from a PDF. also it sohudl allow a txt. file as well. also there should be more guidance as people make their first retreat, with expectations on what is going to be done once they upload and hit make my retreat.

**What was done:** Added "Watch the technical details as it's made", which opens a terminal-style build log on the retreat page. It shows each step ("Next: …") and every call to a model, search service and voice (what was sent, what came back, timing and tokens), live, with a full JSON download. Everything is stored in the llm_calls table with the retreat id: steps and recordings are now logged there too, alongside the model and search calls that already were. Also added two new example source documents on the server ("Be Still", five Psalms of trust; "Blessed", the Beatitudes over six days), each with public-domain paintings, that can be opened as a PDF or used to make a retreat. Also: .txt uploads, and a "What happens when you press Make my retreat" guide, open for a first retreat.

### 96. 2026-09-26, 20:08 UTC

> remove this check box I own this material or have permission to use it.

**What was done:** Removed the checkbox. A short "Use material you have the right to use" stays in the upload box's hint.

### 97. 2026-09-26, 20:12 UTC

> users should be allowed to just paste a bunch of text in to make a retreat as well.

**What was done:** Added "or paste text instead" under the upload box. Pasted text is sent as a text file and planned like any other document.

### 98. 2026-09-26, 20:16 UTC

> do a complete audit of code reability. make sure all code is broken down to be human readable. break down large blocks of code into smaller onces, write useful comments, and generally follow "Clean Code" principles in all code written fro this .  make a markdown file when you are done noting everything you cleaned up and put it in the documentation folder

**What was done:** A readability pass over both repositories, recorded in docs/CODE_CLEANUP.md.

### 99. 2026-09-26, 20:21 UTC

> why does it say this retreat would cost 4.24 but it actually costed $21.13 *(with a screenshot of the Costs page)*

**What was done:** Explained that the estimate described the current settings (Claude Opus 5 with free voices), while the example was made with Claude Fable 5.1 (twice the price) and ElevenLabs voices ($13.87, two-thirds of its cost). Recalibrated the estimate on that real build and made it follow the choices on screen; with Fable and ElevenLabs it now comes to $21.00, against the actual $21.13.

### 100. 2026-09-26, 20:23 UTC

> default new retreats to opus 5.5, show estimated rates / cost when choosing the models

**What was done:** New retreats default to Claude Opus 5.5 (a saved choice that was still the old default follows it). In Advanced, the model menus show their rates, and an estimate for seven days with the chosen model and voices appears under Voices. The Simple tab still shows no prices.

### 101. 2026-09-26, 20:24 UTC

> by default the advanced one should have different voices for the reading and the heart , add a woman's voice for one of them *(with a screenshot of the Voices settings)*

**What was done:** The default voices are now Ava (guide), Andrew (reading), Emma (for the heart) and Christopher (deep dive).

### 102. 2026-09-26, 20:25 UTC

> by default both free and premium should default to different voices. rebuild the current free one to use three different free voices if you haven't already

**What was done:** Re-recorded every day of the free example with Ava, Andrew, Emma and Christopher, keeping its words exactly (new recordings also have exact word timing). The premium example already used four different ElevenLabs voices. Added one-click "Use the free voices" and "Use the ElevenLabs voices" (Sarah, George, Brian, Alice) sets in Advanced.

### 103. 2026-09-26, 20:26 UTC

> is fable much better than opus 5.5 for this kind of work?

**What was done:** Answered that there's no side-by-side comparison on this app's writing yet, gave the price difference (Fable $10/$50 per million tokens against Opus 5.5 $4/$20), and offered to rewrite one day both ways to compare.

### 104. 2026-09-26, 20:30 UTC

> once code review is done do a full pass for design, visuals, and animations. right now its all brown theme and looks blah. it's not fun. make movement be animated, make the visuals look compelling and beautiful. it doesn't have to look "old" or boring, but use your best judgement on how to redesign the visuals for the app.

**What was done:** A visual redesign after the code review merged: a new palette, type, image-led cards and motion throughout, with calm reduced-motion fallbacks.

### 105. 2026-09-26, 20:38 UTC

> the deep dive prompt still doesn't mention that this could be part of a larger retreat, and it's pretty light as a prompt. use fable if possible to generate better default prompts for planning, reflection, and deep dive. I want to be able to see the prompt for the ai companion as well and to tweek it in the app somewhere (tucked away superuser settings or something) . the important thing is to have a deep and robust prompt for all of these given the overall functionality of the app. make sure they are all integrated as a wholistic experience not just a little prompt stub. it can be very long, use prompting best practices from claude guides on prompt design. I expect these prompts to be extensive and world class.

**What was done:** Wrote a brief describing the whole app (what each part receives, where it sits in the listener's day, what the others do) and had Claude Fable 5.1 write every default prompt from it: the shared background, the house style, planning, both heart presets, the deep dive, the guidance tailoring and the companion (13,000 to 26,000 characters each). They now live as plain files in app/prompt_texts/, with the brief and script in docs/prompt-design/. The editable-prompt limit went from 8,000 to 60,000 characters. The companion's instructions are editable per person on the Talk page, and the background and house style are shown read only under Advanced.

### 106. 2026-09-26, 20:38 UTC

> make the ai companion prompt also great, using same principles

**What was done:** Included the companion in the same Fable pass, from the same brief (see 105).

### 107. 2026-09-26, 20:41 UTC

> in the technical details I want to see the real details, like the exact prompts going up to muse/claude and the exact response that comes back. these should be SUPER VERBOSE for a technical person to troubleshoot any issues. for example do an audit that all of the previous days of the retreat were sent up as context when planning

**What was done:** The build log now shows each call in full: the whole system prompt, every message exactly as sent, the whole response and its metadata, with "Copy this call as JSON". An audit of the live "Be Still" build found each day received the earlier days' full reflections and deep dives, and the coming days' readings only, and the deep dive received the day's reflection.

### 108. 2026-09-26, 20:45 UTC

> it should be clear what the talk it over button does, right now it is kind of hidden and i'm not sure what's going to happen when I push the button. find a clever way to let users know what it does, perhaps an animated entrance, and a tool tip that says "have a conversation with a realistic sounding voice to prompt your reflection or something like that I don't know i'm not a writer do something good

**What was done:** "Talk it over" is now a warm pill button with a moving sound-wave icon. It arrives with a glow, and has an explanation card: "Say out loud what's stirring. A conversation, in a natural voice, with a companion that knows this retreat…". The card shows on hover and focus, and opens by itself the first time.

### 109. 2026-09-26, 20:47 UTC

> why show the "whole retreat pdf" button if it doesn't work yet, just hide until complete *(with a screenshot of "The retreat plan isn't ready yet")*

**What was done:** The whole-retreat PDF button stays hidden until the retreat is finished.

### 110. 2026-09-26, 21:17 UTC

> remove whole retreat PDF from the top, it is already at the bottom of the page

**What was done:** Removed the button from the top of the retreat page. The link at the bottom of each day prints only that day, so the whole-retreat PDF moved to the quiet links at the foot of the page ("The whole retreat as a printable PDF"), shown once the retreat is finished.

### 111. 2026-09-26, 21:20 UTC

> how about hide build log and costs links unless the user is in a debug=TRUE mode in the browser. there are two research notes links at the bottom. remove the verbose one that is plain every search results etc. *(with a screenshot of the foot of a retreat page)*

**What was done:** Added a debug mode, turned on by opening the site with ?debug=true (?debug=false turns it off) and remembered in the browser. Without it, the build log link, "Show the technical details", "Watch the technical details" on New retreat and the Costs link are hidden. Removed the long "Research notes for this retreat" link at the foot; each day's short "Research notes" link stays.

### 112. 2026-09-26, 21:23 UTC

> don't do the exact same retreat for the premium and the free examples, have one be come and see and the other be Blessed retreat. build another example to suggest when doing new retreat (instead of blessed since that will already be done).
>
> when you're done rebuild both the premium and the free

**What was done:** The premium example stays "Come and See" (Claude Fable with ElevenLabs), rebuilt with the new prompts and the free research as a head start. The free example is now "Blessed" (Muse with every free search service, four Microsoft voices). A third example document, "I Am" (six of the "I am" sayings in John), replaces Blessed on the New retreat page. The build tool now takes each example from its own document, re-records failed clips, and replaces the old example only when the new one is ready.

### 113. 2026-09-26, 21:24 UTC

> after clicking into the examples add a way to dismiss each example from the home page

**What was done:** An example's page now has "Remove it from my home page". It's saved to the person's account with their progress, so it holds across devices. The home page shows "Show … again" when any are hidden. New endpoint: POST /api/retreats/{id}/hidden.

### 114. 2026-09-26, 21:29 UTC

> Remove all references to JetStream and remove reference to this being homework project

**What was done:** Began a cleanup across both repositories, then narrowed it at the next prompt.

### 115. 2026-09-26, 21:32 UTC

> Just remove references in the app to homework and jetstream the code and repo is fine

**What was done:** Changed only what the app shows. The About page no longer says it was built for a course, model names read "Muse Glimmer (free)" and "Llama 4 Scout (free)", the cost report and build log say "Open models", and error messages say "the open-model service". The code, repositories and documentation are unchanged.

### 116. 2026-09-26, 21:33 UTC

> The visual design of the app is still pretty blah and ai generated looking what would take it to the next level? Don't change anything just give me ideas

**What was done:** Ideas only, with no changes: what reads as AI-generated in the current design, and a recommended direction (a modern book of hours with color taken from each day's painting), with specific moves.

### 117. 2026-09-26, 21:48 UTC

> How many minutes of content? Voices seem really expensive

**What was done:** Measured the new premium example: 47 minutes of recorded speech (about 10 minutes of prayer a day, since the reading plays four times). ElevenLabs charged about 21,600 characters for 43,307 characters of speech, so the app's $12.99 estimate at $0.30 per 1,000 characters overstates the real cost. Suggested setting the real rate, and options to cut voice cost.

### 118. 2026-09-26, 21:51 UTC

> Are the transitions the same for every day and every retreat or are they custom? Should we cache the premium transitions if they are the same?

**What was done:** Checked the premium example: 39 of 49 guidance clips are unique, because the guidance is tailored to each day. Recommended caching recordings by exact text and voice (a small saving, safe) and offered it with the larger voice-cost options.

### 119. 2026-09-26, 21:53 UTC

> Give me mockups of the visual redesign you would do based on our prior discussion here . Use all of the things you suggested to improve visual design and animations

**What was done:** Made a design canvas of the "modern book of hours" direction with live animations: Today at dawn and at night, the prayer screen (the painting zooms to the detail being discussed, a string of beads keeps your place, the spoken word gilds), silence as a candle that burns down to the bell, a prayed day's gilded initial, a day as a two-page spread on a computer, and retreats as a shelf of books.

### 120. 2026-09-26, 22:01 UTC

> I like the visual redesign except that tou call things books and that will be confusing for users unless it's explained. Make an animated intro to books or change the language

**What was done:** Changed the language in the mockups: "My books" became "My retreats" and "Begin a new book" became "Make a new retreat". The book-like covers stay as a look, with no new word to explain.

### 121. 2026-09-26, 22:02 UTC

> I really like the slow animated images

**What was done:** Noted for the real redesign: keep the slow drift and zoom on every painting, and build the "look closer" zoom to the detail each part is about.

### 122. 2026-09-26, 22:08 UTC

> I'm listening to the premium and it spends a lot of time verbally describing the images. That seems really bad, the focus shouldn't be on the image but the words. Why the long description. They can see it. Have a meaningful personal lesson from the heart ones, what does god want people to know in their heart about this scripture

**What was done:** The prompts told every writer to bring in the painting and describe it so someone with closed eyes could see it. They now say the opposite: the listener can see the painting, so don't describe it; mention it at most once, in a few words, and only to point back to the text. The heart reflection (both voices) now has a clear center: one true, personal thing God wants this person to know in their heart through this passage, said plainly once. Tested on the prodigal son day with Claude Opus 5.5: one brief mention of the painting, and a center ("You do not have to finish the apology to be held").

### 123. 2026-09-26, 22:17 UTC

> Do free

**What was done:** The free Blessed example is being brought up to the new prompts: its reflections for the heart and its spoken guidance are rewritten and re-recorded with `tools/rewrite_parts.py`, which keeps each day's deep dive as it was.

### 124. 2026-09-26, 22:18 UTC

> Do the full visual redesign push to main

**What was done:** Built the "modern book of hours" redesign into the web app. Type is Cormorant Garamond and EB Garamond on warm paper with deep ink; rubrics (red small capitals) mark labels and the grace; gold leaf marks what's prayed. Colors are read from each day's painting in the browser (`js/look.js`) and color the Today card, the day page, the retreat covers and the prayer screen, with "today's colors" shown as four dots. The home screen leads with a Today card (the painting, a greeting for the hour, the grace, a gold Pray button); My retreats is a shelf of covers with the painting in an arched window and a gold square per prayed day. A day is a two-page spread on a computer (painting and caption on the left; running head, title, grace, fleuron and a drop-capped passage on the right). The prayer screen has beads on a thread, a gold play button, a candle that burns down through a silence to the bell, and after a day is prayed its first letter is gilded in an illuminated frame beside the week's initials. Paintings drift slowly everywhere. Icons are SVG line drawings instead of symbol characters; Talk it over is restyled to match. Everything is still for reduced motion, focus rings are visible, and the beads and icon buttons have labels. Screenshots in the README were retaken.

### 125. 2026-09-26, 22:27 UTC

> Add a progress bar to the build like have a certain number of sections and progress it every step so I can see progress

(With phone screenshots of a retreat being planned: the painting banner bled past the edges and felt heavy, the title was the raw file name "2-PrepDays.PU2 - rev 1.pdf", and the header wrapped onto three lines.)

**What was done:** The progress card has a segmented bar: one segment for planning, then one per day, each day filling in eight steps (reading recorded, heart written and recorded, deep dive researched, written and recorded, guidance written and recorded). Under it a small-caps line says "Step 13 of 17 · Day 2 · researching and writing the deep dive · 79%". Done segments are gold, the current one has a slow shimmer (none with reduced motion), a failed day is red, and it updates on every poll; the library's "being made" card shows a compact version. While planning, the page says "Your new retreat" with the file name as a small line, and shows no painting banner until the plan and an image exist. The phone header is one line, and the "Signed in as" line moved to About me.

### 126. 2026-09-26, 22:29 UTC

> Make sure we are logging errors

(With a screenshot of a retreat whose planning failed.)

**What was done:** A reply from the free model that was cut off is now logged as an error with its token and character counts. Planning failures say why and are written to the server log. Long handouts on the free model are planned compactly: the model marks the first and last words of each passage and the app copies the passage from the document, so the plan no longer runs out of room. The "2-PrepDays" handout was planned again and succeeded with all seven days.

### 127. 2026-09-26, 22:40 UTC

> If a day is an exercise just say so and say go do the exercise today and have a mark as complete button

**What was done:** Server: the planner marks activity days (worksheets, review or repetition days) as kind "exercise" and copies the handout's instruction word for word; the build writes and records nothing for them. App: an exercise day shows "Today's exercise", its title, the instruction, "Go and do this exercise today, then mark it complete." and a Mark as complete button (then "Completed · date" with a Mark as not complete link), with no Pray button, length or parts. On the home screen the Today card says "Today's exercise" with Mark as complete instead of Pray this day. A completed exercise counts as a prayed day (gold) in the day strip and on the covers, the prayer screen never opens for one, and the build bar counts it done once it's ready.

### 128. 2026-09-26, 23:08 UTC

> Remove the section that says today's colors why is it there

**What was done:** It was a leftover from the mockups, meant to show that each day's colors come from its painting. Removed the "today's colors" dots from the Today card and the day page. The colors still quietly tint each day's page.

### 129. 2026-09-26, 23:12 UTC

> Somewhere it should say what the scripture is by book verse and chapter it does not need to be read outloud though just on the screen somewhere

**What was done:** The prayer screen now shows the scripture reference: in the player's line ("Day 3 · John 4:7–15 · 10:20 left") and above the reading in the text view. The reference is shown in its clean form ("Psalm 8", not "Psalm 8, Preparation Days Prayer Unit 2 Day 1") there, on the day page and on the Today card. The planner now writes source references that way from the start. It is never read aloud.

### 130. 2026-09-26, 23:18 UTC

> The breaks between sections are too long are they all 5 full seconds?

**What was done:** Yes. Every break was a 5-second silence, about 6 seconds with each recording's own silence. Breaks are now shorter by default: a breath of about 1.5 seconds after a guidance line, and about 3 seconds after a reading, the reflection or the deep dive. A new "Pause between parts" setting offers Short, Medium or Long (the old five seconds). Also fixed a bug found while checking: deleting a retreat left its guidance recordings in storage.

### 131. 2026-09-26, 23:20 UTC

> Is there an expand button we could add to make it full screen so you don't see the browser *(with a screenshot of the prayer screen in Chrome on an iPhone)*

**What was done:** Added a full-screen button to the prayer player. On computers, Android and iPad it hides the browser (and leaves full screen when the prayer closes). An iPhone doesn't let websites do that, so there the button explains how to add the app to the Home Screen, where it opens full screen by itself. It notes that the Home Screen app keeps its own sign-in. The button is hidden once the app is opened from the Home Screen.

### 132. 2026-09-26, 23:27 UTC

> This version of the text has numbers in it and. The reader is saying them out loud *(with a screenshot of Romans 8 on the prayer screen showing verse numbers 19, 20, 21)*

**What was done:** Verse numbers are now taken out of every passage when a plan is made. They're recognized by counting up (19, 20, 21…) whatever word follows them, so a number that belongs to the text stays. The compact-plan path had copied them straight from the PDF. Only the "2-PrepDays" retreat was affected (Day 4, Romans 8, and Day 5, Psalm 33); both readings were cleaned and recorded again.

### 133. 2026-09-26, 23:28 UTC

> Those four colored circles aren't doing anything *(with a screenshot of the day page)*

**What was done:** The circles had already been removed, and the reference already cleaned ("Romans 8:18–25"); the phone was showing an older copy of the page (GitHub Pages lets browsers keep it for up to ten minutes). The app now checks for a newer version when it opens and whenever the tab comes back into view, and reloads itself if there is one, but never in the middle of a prayer or a conversation.

### 134. 2026-09-26, 23:57 UTC

> When I tap start talking it briefly shows an error or something underneath and then says microphone note allowed *(with a screenshot of the Talk page in Chrome on an iPhone)*

**What was done:** The app asks for the microphone right on the tap, so the refusal comes from the phone or browser. On an iPhone the browser asks only once per site; after that, or when the phone blocks the microphone for the browser, it refuses without asking. The message now says exactly where to allow it for the browser in use (for Chrome on iPhone: Settings, Apps, Chrome, Microphone), and shows the error name in small print.

### 135. 2026-09-27, 01:22 UTC

> Create a feature that narrates the user though these steps of a prayer practiced. The voice narrates and leaves blank time like 2 minutes and a two minute timer to journal answer to a question. So choice of audio model that is deluxe like eleven labs and a standard model like the Microsoft text to speech. Compare prices of eleven labs credit for tts vs free for the voice of narrating this much text . Use Claude opus 5.5 model to generate narration script and calculate how much time to wait in between each question to journal answer. *(with a photo of the "Creating a Prayer Practice" handout)*

**What was done:** A new Practice page (in the header once signed in). Claude Opus 5.5 wrote two guided sessions from the handout, a daily prayer practice (about 17 minutes) and a weekly review (about 11 minutes), and chose the length of every silence and journaling pause. The narration was recorded once in a free Microsoft voice (Ava) and an ElevenLabs voice (Sarah), and the person picks between them. Silences show a countdown ring and end with a soft bell; journaling pauses give a writing box, and each answer is saved to the account. The weekly review shows the week's notes. Cost: the narration for all three sessions is 7,071 characters, which ElevenLabs charged at 3,535 credits (about 2.5% of a month's credits, roughly $1 to $2); the Microsoft voice is free; the Opus scripts cost about $0.30, once.

### 136. 2026-09-27, 01:24 UTC

> Create an exercise in the app that narrates me through these steps while I write. Put a timer on how long it things I should write in response to each question to get 30 minutes total of a session of reflection *(with a photo of the "Disposition Days, Unit 2, Day 3" dossier handout)*

**What was done:** A third session, "Your Life's Faith Story", paraphrased from the handout (adapted from Margaret Silf's *Inner Compass*, credited). Opus 5.5 set the writing time for each question so that the whole session comes to about 30 minutes: 3:00, 3:00, 4:50, 4:50, 3:00 and 3:00, with two minutes of silence with God at the end. A retreat's dossier exercise day now has a "Do the guided exercise" button.

### 137. 2026-09-27, 01:25 UTC

> This one only needs to be made once since it will be the same each day

**What was done:** The sessions are generated and recorded once and shipped with the web app, so every person and every day uses the same audio and nothing is paid for again.

### 138. 2026-09-27, 01:27 UTC

> What is a dossier

**What was done:** Answered: a file of papers about a person; here, a written summary of your life's faith story (people, places, turning points, where God seemed near or far) that you bring into a retreat.

### 139. 2026-09-27, 01:59 UTC

> I put $5 monthly subscription and then 20 for api for those credits how much money is 30 minute s

**What was done:** Checked the ElevenLabs account (Starter, 139,020 credits this month, about $0.18 per 1,000). Thirty minutes of continuous narration is about 25,000 characters, about 12,500 credits, about $2.25; the thirty-minute dossier session is mostly silence, so its 3,585 spoken characters cost about $0.32, once.

### 140. 2026-09-27, 02:52 UTC

> *(a long pasted explanation of the Ignatian Examen: presence, gratitude, reviewing the day and its inner movements, consolation and desolation, forgiveness and "what was I actually seeking?", looking toward tomorrow, and the two-question variation)* Build an audio for ignitian examine at end of day. Use a British man's voice if possible use Microsoft tts and option for elevenlabs premium . Have a premium version that rights your own customized version based on your life guided audio tour of your day where was god in your teaching today with tour family in the car etc but in your art or in nature or whatever customized to the person

**What was done:** A fourth guided session, "The Examen" (about fifteen minutes, written by Claude Opus 5.5 from the pasted notes), recorded once in two British men's voices: Ryan (Microsoft, free) and George (ElevenLabs). Mostly silences, two optional writing pauses, and the Our Father at the end. Premium accounts can also have "Your own Examen": Opus writes one around their life from their About me notes and what they add about their days (work, the drive with the family, art, nature), and it's recorded for them (about $0.13 for the script and about 2,500 ElevenLabs credits in George's voice, or free in Ryan's). New: `POST/GET /api/practice/examen`, app/my_examen.py, app/prompt_texts/my_examen.md.

### 141. 2026-09-27, 02:56 UTC

> Build a quiet visual image of a candle or animation or relevant icons paintings religious art that may be relevant to be played during the examine while the person visualizing and responds to the prompts

**What was done:** During the Examen a painting for each step drifts slowly and cross-fades to the next (La Tour's Magdalen with the Smoking Flame, Millet's Angelus, Rembrandt's Supper at Emmaus and Return of the Prodigal Son, Friedrich's Moonrise over the Sea, Van Gogh's Starry Night; public domain, from Wikimedia Commons), with a small animated candle. A switch changes it to the candle alone or to nothing.

### 142. 2026-09-27, 02:57 UTC

> Build an advanced option to have music or chanting playing in the background. Find a service that does ai generated music or does sourcing of open commons chanting or religious music that is very simple

**What was done:** Advanced, on the Practice page: background music, off by default. Gregorian chant is five open-licence recordings from Wikimedia Commons (credited on the page). A quiet organ and strings piece was made with the ElevenLabs Music API (2 minutes for 1,500 credits, about $0.27). The music dips while the voice speaks and comes back up in the silences, with a volume slider. It goes through Web Audio, because iPhones ignore an audio element's volume.

### 143. 2026-09-27, 03:03 UTC

> When I try to do my save as desktop icon and open it I get a mostly blank screen *(with screenshots of the Home Screen icon and the blank app)*

**What was done:** The page drew nothing until the server answered, and the server (on Render) sleeps after a quiet spell and takes up to a minute to wake. The Home Screen app also has its own storage, so it starts signed out with nothing saved. Now a waiting screen appears after a second, and the sign-in settings are remembered so the sign-in page can show at once. Because the sign-in email's link opens in Safari rather than in the Home Screen app, the sign-in page also takes a pasted link ("Using it from your Home Screen? Paste the link").

### 144. 2026-09-27, 03:08 UTC

> This finally showed up I guess the back end was idle we should show a simple waiting for servers to wake up from rest to give you a time of escaped or something similar a fun and random phrase for first warm up or the days. We run on cheap hardware that sometimes need a moment to warm back up. Take a moment to breath through the bottom of your belly why you wait a moment

**What was done:** The waiting screen has a random gentle phrase ("The sacristan is finding the keys…", "Brother Server is putting on his sandals…"), a note that the app runs on modest hardware that rests when no one is praying, a seconds counter, and a golden circle that grows and shrinks for slow belly breathing (in for four seconds, out for six).

### 145. 2026-09-27, 03:05 UTC

> Users should be able to upload a photo of something like a book that has five verses on it or anything that could be an inspiration for a retreat for example suggest the parables of Jesus for a retreat of seven days and build a daily audio series on it for meditation

**What was done:** Two new ways to start a retreat. A photo (JPEG or PNG) can be uploaded as the material, and the planner reads it like a scanned page. And "or start from an idea or a photo": the person describes an idea ("the parables of Jesus"), chooses how many days, and can add a photo. A model chooses one passage a day (app/inspiration.py, prompt in app/prompt_texts/inspiration.md). Verses in the photo are copied exactly as printed; every other passage is fetched from the World English Bible (public domain) through bible-api.com, so no scripture is written by a model. The result is planned and made like any upload. Tried on "the parables, seven days" ("The Kingdom Is Like This") and on an anxious-trust idea with a photo of Psalm 121 and Isaiah 43 (the photo's verses became days one and two, word for word).

### 146. 2026-09-27, 03:17 UTC

> Play or stop a sample button is not doing anything

**What was done:** With the music set to None (the default) the sample had nothing to play. It now plays the chant when None is chosen, otherwise the chosen music; the button says "Stop the sample" while it plays; changing the choice switches what's playing; and leaving the page stops it.

### 147. 2026-09-27, 03:21 UTC

> Is the image cut off on top *(with a screenshot of the Examen on an iPhone, in dark mode)*

**What was done:** Yes: the painting was cropped to fill a wide frame, so a tall painting lost its top (the Magdalen's face). Now the whole painting shows, never cropped, over a soft blurred copy of itself that fills the frame, and the slow drift is gentler. Also fixed: the header's links ran off the right edge on phones (they now sit on their own row under the name), text could hide behind the buttons, and skipping quickly through the steps left old paintings stacked up underneath.

### 148. 2026-09-27, 03:27 UTC

> Can you install a developer kit that lets you test on a software drive iPhone harness

**What was done:** Checked the Mac: it has Apple's command-line tools but not Xcode, which the iPhone Simulator needs. Xcode comes from the App Store with the owner's Apple ID, so the owner installs it and accepts the licence; after that the iOS runtime can be downloaded and a simulated iPhone driven from the command line (opening pages in iPhone Safari, screenshots, dark mode). Waiting on the Xcode install.

### 149. 2026-09-27, 03:34 UTC

> The screen shows it stopped but it seemed to be still playing . Turning off the screen sometimes stops progress *(with a screenshot of the lock screen, paused at 0:13)*

**What was done:** With the screen off, an iPhone stops a page's timers unless audio is playing, and a page that isn't playing can't start a new sound on its own. The silences and writing pauses played nothing, so the countdown froze and the next clip was refused. Now one audio player plays the whole session in sequence: the narration, then a near-silent track looped through each silence, then the bell, then the next narration. The countdowns run on the clock, so they're right when the screen comes back. The Play/Pause button and the lock screen follow what's really playing; the lock screen shows the step and has play, pause, next and back.

### 150. 2026-09-27, 03:45 UTC

> Why are follow me and come and see using the same cover art we need more variety of striking images not duplicate *(with screenshots of the home page)*

**What was done:** "Follow Me" is Day 1 of Come and See, and a retreat's cover was its first day's painting, so with Come and See in the Today card the same painting showed twice. The retreat list now sends every day's painting, and a cover never repeats the painting in the Today card: it uses another day's (for Come and See on Day 1, Day 2's).

### 151. 2026-09-27, 03:46 UTC

> Should just switch to a login and send magic link with option to paste magic link *(with a screenshot of the guest card: "A user with this email address has already been registered")*

**What was done:** Sign-in is now two steps on one card: email me a sign-in link, then "Then paste the link here" appears at once, with how to copy the link on a phone ("Already have a sign-in link? Paste it" opens it directly). On the guest card, an email that already has an account now offers "Sign in to that account instead", which leaves the guest session, sends the link and shows the paste box; the card also has "I already have an account: sign in".

### 152. 2026-09-27, 03:50 UTC

> Do a web search for screen names that would be good for this app and cheap

*(and, a moment later, at 03:50 UTC:)* 

> I mean web address url like ignatiusretreat.com

**What was done:** Searched current registrar prices (a .com is about $10 to $11 a year at Porkbun or Cloudflare, the same at renewal; .app about $10, then about $15 a year) and checked about forty names against the registries themselves. Available: ignatiusretreat.com, ignatiusathome.com, ignatiusathome.app, pocketretreat.com, eveningexamen.com and more; taken: retreatathome.com, ignatianretreat.com, examen.app, comeandsee.app and others. Suggested ignatiusathome.com with ignatiusretreat.com pointing to it (about $21 a year); GitHub Pages can serve the site at a custom address for free.

### 153. 2026-09-27, 03:54 UTC

> On iPhone this pops up iCloud I can't choose Google Docs or drive *(with a screenshot of the About me page)*

**What was done:** An iPhone's file picker shows Google Drive only when the Drive app is installed and turned on in Files, and even then Google Docs often can't be picked as files. About me now also takes a Google Doc link (shared as "Anyone with the link can view"), read the same way as a retreat's Google Doc source: `POST /api/profile/google-doc`.

### 154. 2026-09-27, 04:01 UTC

> Rotate this screen it always says the same thing give updates at each stage such as planning day 5 or converting reading to voice now converting deep drive to voice converting heart lesson to voice compiling all pieces etc give text updates on this screen *(with a screenshot of "Planning your retreat")*

**What was done:** A live line under the progress bar says what is happening now. While Claude plans, the plan is read as it streams in ("Planning day 5: The Lost Sheep"); each step of a day shows as it starts ("Day 2: writing the reflection for the heart", "Day 2: researching the passage and writing the deep dive", "Day 2: turning the deep dive into voice"). While a model plans in one reply that can't be followed (the free model), the stages of planning take turns every few seconds. The server keeps the line in memory on the retreat being made, so it costs no extra saves.

### 155. 2026-09-27, 04:02 UTC

> It's been hanging here for like 10 seconds or longer *(with a screenshot of a blank page, header only)*

### 156. 2026-09-27, 04:06 UTC

> Hanging a long time *(with a screenshot of the same blank page in Chrome)*

**What was done (155 and 156):** A bug in the version just published: the new Google Doc box on About me was a form inside the About me form, which browsers drop, so starting up failed on it and nothing drew. Fixed, and start-up now wires each part of the page separately, so one missing piece can't stop the app. The waiting screen is now part of the page itself (it fades in after a moment even before any script runs, and suggests reopening the app after twenty seconds), and the sign-in library (supabase-js 2.117.2) is served with the app instead of from a separate CDN.

### 157. 2026-09-27, 04:05 UTC

> Build a bank of quotes form desert fathers and mothers or Richard roar or st ignatius or profound thoughts and quotes in this space St. John of the cross Julian of Norwich Thomas Merton cs Lewis people Jim Finley has covered in his podcast turning to the mystics put those up on waiting screens when building a retreat or on initial load if it is taking time and the back end is not respond show a waking up screen with quotes

**What was done:** js/quotes.js: thirty-seven short sayings with sources, from the desert mothers and fathers, Saint Ignatius, Saint John of the Cross, Julian of Norwich, Saint Teresa, Augustine, Meister Eckhart, The Cloud of Unknowing, Brother Lawrence, Thérèse of Lisieux, Francis de Sales, Hopkins, Guigo II, Thomas Merton, C. S. Lewis and Richard Rohr. Only sayings that trace to the person are used (several famous ones are misattributed); two traditional ones are marked "attributed". They rotate on the waiting screen (a Julian of Norwich line is built into the page, so it shows before any script) and on the screen for a retreat being made.

### 158. 2026-09-27, 04:08 UTC

> The app should have the option to allow customize this retreat based on info in the about section and then uncheck for a generic version

**What was done:** New retreat has "Make it personal: shape the reflections with what I've told you in About me", ticked by default; untick it for a general retreat. The choice is kept with the retreat (`personal`), so rebuilding a day later follows it; a general retreat's model calls leave the About me notes out entirely. If About me is empty, the page says it will be a general retreat for now.

### 159. 2026-09-27, 04:15 UTC

> I can't get the screen to render on iOS still

**What was done:** Most likely the phone still held the broken page (GitHub Pages lets it be kept ten minutes, and Home Screen apps sometimes longer), and that page crashes before it can check for an update. Added a start-up guard written into the page itself: any error while opening shows a note with a Reload button and is reported to the server (`POST /api/client-error`, kept per day; `tools/client_errors.py` prints them), and a page that hasn't started after eight seconds checks for a newer version and reloads into it, once.

### 160. 2026-09-27, 14:05 UTC

> I can't sign in on home screen app *(with a screenshot: "Couldn't sign in: Email link is invalid or has expired")*

**What was done:** Sign-in links work once, and on an iPhone even pressing and holding a link can preview it, which uses it up. New way into a Home Screen app: tap the link in the email as usual; the browser signs in and, on an iPhone, shows an eight-digit code; type the code into the Home Screen app. The server exchanges the code for a fresh one-time sign-in token made by Supabase for that person without sending any email (admin generate_link), and the app signs in with it. Codes work once, last ten minutes, and wrong guesses are limited (`POST /api/handoff`, `POST /api/handoff/redeem`). Anyone signed in can also get a code from About me ("Sign in on another device"). Pasting the link stays as a fallback.

### 161. 2026-09-27, 14:07 UTC

> Ok chrome is my default on iOS is that a problem

**What was done:** No: the email's link then opens in Chrome instead of Safari, and the code works the same from either. The wording now says "your browser (Safari or Chrome)".

### 162. 2026-09-27, 14:12 UTC

> I don't see how to go back to the menu from here *(with a screenshot of the prayer screen, its text cut off at the right)*

### 163. 2026-09-27, 14:13 UTC

> I didn't zoom it is at standard width

**What was done (162 and 163):** The close button (top right) had been pushed off the screen: a long part name in the player ("Opening: asking for the grace") couldn't shrink inside its row, so it widened the whole prayer screen (to 439px on a 393px iPhone), cutting off the close button, the text and the third button. The name's box can now shrink, so the name wraps, and the prayer screen can't scroll sideways. Also, every text box is now at least 16px, since iPhone browsers zoom into smaller ones.

### 164. 2026-09-27, 17:28 UTC

> i only see the design spec in the readme linked to IMPROVEMENTS.md, but there was an extensive design spec when the project started. link to the original design spec and build plan in the readme

**What was done:** Found the original documents (September 25, before any code) in the private planning repository, bcollier/ignatius-at-home, which also holds the retreat handout PDFs. With the owner's go-ahead, copied the design spec, technical spec and build plan unchanged into `docs/original-spec/` here (after checking they hold no keys, personal details or quoted handout text), with a short README on where they came from and how the project changed; linked them at the top of both READMEs, in the docs table, and at the start of the build journal. The redesign spec (IMPROVEMENTS.md) is now labelled as such.

### 165. 2026-09-27, 17:34 UTC

> add links and specifics, which web research servcies (six web research services) , links to elevenlabs voices , on this diagram specify wht "for the heart" is and "deep dive"

**What was done:** The backend README's "Inside a day" diagram now says what each part is (the reading; For the heart, a short spoken reflection on what God may want the listener to know in their heart, in a companion's voice or Jesus speaking; the deep dive, a close reading of setting, original-language words, how the Church has read it and open questions), names the six research services and the default voices, and is followed by a table with each part's prompt, model and default voices (linked to their samples) and linked lists of the research services (Brave Search, Brave Answers, Exa, Tavily, Firecrawl, Linkup, and Claude's own web search) and voice providers (Microsoft through edge-tts, ElevenLabs and its voice library). The "system at a glance" diagram and table name them too, with links.

### 166. 2026-09-27, 17:34 UTC

> make sure opus 5.5 is hte default *(quoting the README's model table, which called Claude Opus 5 the premium default)*

**What was done:** The live server already defaulted to Opus 5.5 (`LLM_MODEL`), but the documents said Opus 5. Fixed the model tables in both READMEs, the settings tables, the architecture diagram and the example API responses in ARCHITECTURE.md (their costs recalculated at Opus 5.5's $4 / $20 per million tokens), and the model menu now lists "Claude Opus 5.5 (default)" first. Opus 5.5 is also cheaper than Opus 5 ($5 / $25).

### 167. 2026-09-27, 17:38 UTC

> I don't see much in the doc about render as a server, on here. somewhere in the doc list a table of all the free services used take make this come together and what they are. list micorosoft voice api, even though i use the free model from Jetstream since this is an academic project for a class, you can also use the free models from OpenRouter (list some that are free right now) or host your own model (ollama, etc). you could also easily switch to an openai key. also list paid services (openai live 1 and elevenlabs)

**What was done:** A new section in the frontend README, "Services: what runs it, free and paid": a table of the free services (GitHub Pages, Render, Supabase, Jetstream2, Microsoft's voices through edge-tts, the six research services, bible-api.com, Wikimedia Commons, Google Docs export, Google Fonts), each with what it is, what it does here and why it's free; a table of the paid ones (Claude through OpenRouter with prices, ElevenLabs voices and music, OpenAI GPT-Live-1, xAI Grok voice); and how to swap the free model by changing three settings: OpenRouter's free models (listed live from OpenRouter's catalog: Nemotron 3 Ultra and Super, Gemma 4 31B, Qwen3.8 27B, Inkling, or the free router), your own model with Ollama, or an OpenAI key. The backend README's hosting section now describes Render as the server in detail.

### 168. 2026-09-27, 17:38 UTC

> when was the original design from my private repo made? add that as a step in the how it was built phase

**What was done:** From the private repository's history: the design grew out of a session on September 24 to 25 (daily documents for a 19th Annotation retreat, then the design spec, voices and director, technical spec, twenty screen designs and the build plan); its first commit was at 1:27 a.m. Eastern on Thursday, September 25, and it was renamed Ignatius at Home at 4:54 p.m. that day. Added as the first step of the build journal.

### 169. 2026-09-27, 17:39 UTC

> in the how it was made, stress that I did spec driven development first, then a large spec driven revision, then a deep code cleanup with clean code principles, then a visual redesign based on a spec, etc.

**What was done:** The build journal now opens with "The method: spec-driven, in phases": spec first; building to the spec; a large spec-driven revision (IMPROVEMENTS.md); a deep Clean Code cleanup (with its real numbers from CODE_CLEANUP.md); the prompts rewritten from a brief; a visual redesign from approved mockups; then testing on a real iPhone, every fix logged here.

### 170. 2026-09-27, 17:42 UTC

> add visual redesign spec and code review guidance

**What was done:** Two new documents. [docs/VISUAL_REDESIGN.md](https://github.com/bcollier/ignatius-hw4-api/blob/main/docs/VISUAL_REDESIGN.md) is the visual redesign spec, assembled from the design conversation: why the earlier look read as AI-made, the "modern book of hours" direction and its eight moves, what was stripped out, the seven approved mockups (rendered from the Claude Design boards into images in `docs/visual-redesign/`), the decisions made on them ("books" became "retreats"; keep the drifting paintings), and a table of what was built and what wasn't ("Look closer" zooms). [docs/CODE_REVIEW.md](https://github.com/bcollier/ignatius-hw4-api/blob/main/docs/CODE_REVIEW.md) is code review guidance: how a change should arrive (from a spec, logged), the Clean Code principles, and checklists for the API and for the web app on iPhones, each tied to a real bug found in this project. Both are linked from the READMEs and the build method; the design section no longer mentions the "today's colors" dots, which were removed.

### 171. 2026-09-27, 17:47 UTC

> is all this pushed to github main?

**What was done:** Checked: both repositories on `main`, nothing uncommitted, local and GitHub at the same commit.

### 172. 2026-09-27, 17:55 UTC

> check both repos for any API keys, secrets, or other security concerns

**What was done:** Scanned the full history of both repositories with gitleaks (84 and 70 commits: no leaks), and searched every commit for the actual values of the twelve secret keys in `.env` (none appear; `.env` has always been ignored). The only personal data is the owner's own email (the premium allowlist), in the prompt log, ARCHITECTURE.md and a test. Reviewed the code: the nine routes open without sign-in are the intended ones (health, public settings, examples, error reports, the code exchange); the local file server isn't present in production; example files can't be read outside their folder; `/api/options` exposes only the public Supabase settings; other people see an example's build log with the owner's About me notes replaced by "[private]"; the printable PDF escapes all text; CORS allows only the real site; and pip-audit finds no known vulnerabilities. One fix: links on the research page came straight from web search results, so a result with a `javascript:` address could have run code when clicked; now only http and https addresses become links.

### 173. 2026-09-27, 17:56 UTC

> if htey are merged they can be squashed right ? *(with a screenshot of GitHub's branches page showing `redesign`)*

### 174. 2026-09-27, 17:56 UTC

> same here *(the other repository's branches page)*

**What was done (173 and 174):** Both `redesign` branches are fully merged into `main` (no commits of their own), so they can be deleted without losing anything; squashing isn't needed.

### 175. 2026-09-27, 18:04 UTC

> walk me through setting up a simple login flow smtp thing we didn't have time to do before

**What was done:** Checked collier.phd: its mail already runs on Google Workspace and its SPF record authorizes Google, so the simplest setup is Supabase sending through the owner's Google account with an app password (smtp.gmail.com, port 465), with no DNS changes; Resend stays documented as the alternative. `docs/email-templates.md` now has the setup steps, and the Magic Link and Confirm templates include the six-digit code (`{{ .Token }}`) beside the link. The app's code box takes that six-digit code (checked by Supabase with the email address it went to), so a Home Screen app can sign in straight from the email, as well as the eight-digit code from a signed-in browser.

### 176. 2026-09-27, 18:11 UTC

> I don't see templates, take over browser https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/…/auth/templates

**What was done:** Opened the page in Chrome; Supabase asked to sign in, which the owner does (Claude doesn't sign in to accounts). Explained that Supabase keeps the templates locked until custom SMTP is on, so SMTP comes first.

### 177. 2026-09-27, 18:13 UTC

> i do'nt see docs/emial-templatse on github

**What was done:** It's in the backend repository: `ignatius-hw4-api/docs/email-templates.md`.

### 178. 2026-09-27, 18:16 UTC

> ok all done we good to try now?

### 179. 2026-09-27, 18:17 UTC

> oh you are on the mac mini, I'm on the laptop

**What was done (178 and 179):** The owner set up SMTP and the templates on the laptop; the Mac mini's Chrome isn't signed in to Supabase, so the settings were tested by trying a sign-in instead. Closed the tab.

### 180. 2026-09-27, 18:19 UTC

> i still got the paste a link sign in page *(with a screenshot of the sign-in page on a laptop)*

**What was done:** The code box was shown only on iPhones. Now that the sign-in email carries a six-digit code, the code box shows on every device ("Then enter the code from the email", or just click the link), and pasting the link is folded away as a last resort.

### 181. 2026-09-27, 18:22 UTC

> does claude code know everything about me (memories) the same wya claude chat does? I want to have it write the "about me" page

**What was done:** Explained that Claude Code and the Claude chat app keep separate memories; suggested asking Claude chat for a first-person summary to bring over, to be shaped here into About me.

### 182. 2026-09-27, 18:24 UTC

> If I have a profile in the about me page and I use one of the example retreats will it customize the retreat to me?

**What was done:** The finished example retreats are the same for everyone; Talk it over and your own Examen use About me with them.

### 183. 2026-09-27, 18:25 UTC

> I meant these examples *(with a screenshot of the Be Still and I Am example documents on New retreat)*

**What was done:** Yes: "Use this example" makes a new retreat from that document, written with the About me notes when Make it personal is ticked (the default); the scripture is unchanged.

### 184. 2026-09-27, 18:27 UTC

> *(pasted a long first-person "About me, for a prayer companion" summary from Claude chat, not reproduced here since it is personal)*

**What was done:** Shaped it into the app's two boxes: About me (who, work, faith, how I pray, what I'm carrying, questions, hopes, patterns) and What I'm looking for in the conversation companion; both under the 6,000-character limit so nothing is condensed. Dropped names of people outside the family; noted that the notes go with each request to the model providers.

### 185. 2026-09-27, 18:30 UTC

> write a script for me to record the video, show off all the features including write my examen, customized retreats, and a session with the live AI talk

**What was done:** A scene-by-scene demo script (about eight minutes) with preparation, what to show and what to say, including a personalized retreat, Talk it over and Write my Examen.

### 186. 2026-09-27, 18:31 UTC

> for showing the iphone version, is there an iphone simulator I can use on my desktop

**What was done:** Suggested recording the real iPhone through QuickTime and a cable (with sound), iPhone Mirroring, or Xcode's Simulator.

### 187. 2026-09-27, 18:32 UTC

> walk me through installing the Xcode iphone simulator

**What was done:** Step by step: Xcode from the App Store, the iOS platform, opening Simulator, adding the app to its Home Screen, recording, and shortcuts.

### 188. 2026-09-27, 18:38 UTC

> are my airpods gen 3 better for recording than my macbook audio? I recorded from macbook last time and the audio quality was pretty bad

**What was done:** No: using AirPods as a microphone on a Mac drops Bluetooth into a low-quality call mode. Suggested the MacBook or iPhone mic close up, AirPods for listening only, capturing the app's audio directly as system audio, and a quieter, softer room.

### 189. 2026-09-27, 18:50 UTC

> how do I enable debug mode

**What was done:** Open the site once with `?debug=true` (it stays on in that browser; `?debug=false` turns it off).

### 190. 2026-09-27, 18:51 UTC

> I still don't have the option to watch technical details

**What was done:** Debug mode worked in testing; explained where the three places are (the checkbox above Make my retreat, the link under the progress bar, the build log at the foot of a finished retreat, and Costs in the footer). Added a "Debug" marker to the header while debug mode is on, which also turns it off.

### 191. 2026-09-27, 19:04 UTC

> for the run that is going right now, I had elevenlabs read the passage. it looks like it is recording a seperate version for each reading, is that true? why? should we just use the same recording four times?

**What was done:** Checked the call log for the retreat being made: the passage is recorded once per day (one ElevenLabs recording) and played for all four readings; the other nine recordings a day are the reflection, the deep dive and the short spoken lead-ins to each reading, which the live progress line reports one by one.

### 192. 2026-09-27, 19:06 UTC

> if i just take a picture of 5 verses will it make a 5 day retreat or how does it determine the number of days for this retreat?

**What was done:** Explained the two ways: uploaded as the material, the planner follows any days on the page, and otherwise shapes an arc of "about seven days, fewer when the material honestly supports fewer" (usually one passage a day for five good passages); under "Start from an idea or a photo" the person chooses the number of days, the photo's verses come first word for word, and any extra days are chosen to fit.

### 193. 2026-09-27, 19:47 UTC

> finalize the prompt log, and add this app to the others in my portfolio page https://github.com/bcollier/ben.collier.phd

**What was done:** Brought the log's header up to date (the dates, the phases of the build, the tools, Opus 5.5 as the default) and checked the numbering (193 entries, none missing or repeated). Added Ignatius at Home to the portfolio page's projects, following that repository's rules: a branch, the entry in `data/portfolio.json` with a new screenshot of a day as a two-page spread, the page regenerated with `scripts/build.py`, and a pull request squash-merged into `main`.

### 194. 2026-09-27, 19:50 UTC

> the sign up email give me an 8 digit code, the sign in box says it is looking for a 6 digit code. when I put the code in just now it was rejected

**What was done:** This Supabase project issues eight-digit email codes, and the app sent every eight-digit code to the browser-code exchange (whose codes are also eight digits), so the email's code was rejected. Now any code is first checked with Supabase against the email address it went to, and only if that fails is an eight-digit code tried as a browser code; the page asks for "the code from the email" without a length.

### 195. 2026-09-27, 19:53 UTC

> in the web repo none of the screenshots show the talking to a companion screen

**What was done:** Took two screenshots of Talk it over with the Come and See example: on a laptop before a conversation (what the companion knows, the voice, Start talking), and on an iPhone during one, with the orb in its speaking state and a short sample exchange (labelled as a sample, since a live call can't be captured headless). Added them to the frontend README's screenshots and to its Talk it over section.

### 196. 2026-09-27, 19:58 UTC

> i'm trying to build my own examine using the iphone web app, but I weirdly can't scroll down past this picture to see if it's running *(with a screenshot of the Practice page in the Home Screen app, its text running under the status bar)*

**What was done:** A known iPhone bug in Home Screen apps: when the keyboard closes while the box you were typing in disappears (here the "What are your days like?" form, hidden once the Examen is being made), the page can stay shifted and stop short of the bottom. Now Write my Examen closes the keyboard first and scrolls to "Writing your Examen…", and in a Home Screen app any text box losing focus nudges the page back into place. Checking the server showed the Examen had started but then been cut off: pushing to the API repository redeploys Render, which restarts the server and ended the job, leaving it "making" for twenty minutes. Now an Examen interrupted by a restart starts again by itself with the same notes and voice (at most twice), and one that can't is marked failed at once rather than after twenty minutes.

### 197. 2026-09-27, 20:18 UTC

> I was using the home screen app and on this screen it was playing but would not let me scroll down to reach the buttons below *(with a screenshot of the Examen player)*

### 198. 2026-09-27, 20:19 UTC

> I have the same problem here, it will not let me scroll down any further than this *(with a screenshot of the Practice page)*

**What was done (197 and 198):** Scrolling froze in the Home Screen app on more than one page, with no keyboard involved, so the earlier keyboard explanation wasn't the whole story. The prime suspect is the cross-fade between views (the browser's view transitions): the app is a single page, so if WebKit on an iPhone leaves scrolling broken after one transition, every later page is stuck until the app is reopened, and Chrome on an iPhone uses the same engine. Views now switch without the cross-fade on iPhones and iPads. And the guided practice's controls (Back, Pause, Next, the picture switch and End the exercise) are now pinned to the bottom of the screen on a solid bar, like the prayer screen's player, so they're always within reach.

### 199. 2026-09-27, 20:25 UTC

> it no longer gets stuck, but the ordering on the practice page should be redone. if the user has customized any prayers they should be at the top, then there should be a done recently, then the library of standard prayer

**What was done:** The Practice page now has three parts: "Your prayers" (your own Examen, once made), "Done recently" (the last three sessions, newest first, from sessions started on this device and from journal entries saved to the account, so a session on the laptop counts on the phone too), and "The library" of standard sessions. Writing your own Examen ("Write a new Examen" once one exists) comes after the library, then the voice and music settings, then the journal.

### 200. 2026-09-27, 20:29 UTC

> for me personally I really liked how this prompt was done as a voice of God talking right to you, it is a beautiful exercise in listening to God in a new way that is very tangible. it is fun imagination. so I would like most people to get the prompt we already have, but I want some option in the app for a prompt where God is imaginatively talking with you. *(followed by a long "Voice guide: writing the listenable block": Jesus speaking directly to the listener in the second person, warm and direct about faults and then welcoming, knowing the listener through patterns rather than facts, never using real names, a structure for the day's block, prohibitions, and a Psalm 139 excerpt)*

**What was done:** Rewrote the "In the voice of Jesus" reflection prompt (`app/prompt_texts/heart_christ.md`) around the author's guide, generalized from one person to whoever is praying: the voice, the shape of the block, making it personal through patterns (never facts from the notes or real names; guesses phrased so they can be declined), the prohibitions, and the Psalm 139 excerpt, keeping the earlier prompt's grounding in Ignatius's imaginative prayer and its safeguards (no promises the text doesn't make, no new teaching, no deciding for the person). The companion's reflection stays the default; New retreat now offers "The reflection for the heart: a companion's reflection, or Jesus speaking to you" on the main page, and the choice is saved by name so prompt updates always apply (an old saved copy of the earlier prompt is converted). A test on Mark 1:16-20 read as intended.

### 201. 2026-09-27, 20:31 UTC

> I really liked these "heart" examples as well as the "deep dive" examples. I wonder if it would help the prompt to have written examples like N-shot learning in the context *(with the author's document "Bridges PU2 - Close Reading and Reflections")*

**What was done:** Yes, with care: the prompts are shared by everyone and public, so the examples must carry no personal details, models copy long examples closely (and would repeat them when someone prays the same psalm), and an example's facts travel with it (the document had one slip: "heavenly beings" in Psalm 8:5 is the ESV, not the NIV). Added short excerpts rather than whole reflections, labelled as register and not content: the Psalm 104 "fenced sea" passage to the voice-of-Jesus prompt, beside the Psalm 139 excerpt, and the Psalm 104:26 Leviathan passage (facts checked) to the deep dive prompt.

### 202. 2026-09-27, 20:34 UTC

> could we make a free version of the ai companion in the app? it would probably require TTS and STT models that are free and maybe lower quality, or if it was an iPhone app we could use the built in tools

**What was done:** Answered with a plan, not yet built: the browser's own speech recognition (free, in Chrome and in Safari on iPhone) for listening, the free Jetstream model with the same companion instructions and context for the replies, and Microsoft's free voices sentence by sentence for speaking; turn-taking rather than live interruption, with a few seconds before each reply. A native iPhone app could use Apple's on-device speech instead, but that is a much larger project.

### 203. 2026-09-27, 20:36 UTC

> when I mark a day as prayed "Mark a Day as Prayed" there is no good visual queue that it succeeded. Put something simple that says Day marked as prayed

**What was done:** Marking a day now shows a short message at the bottom of the screen, "Day 3 marked as prayed." (or "marked as complete" for an exercise day, and "marked as not prayed" when undone), wherever it's done: the day's page, after praying, or the Today card.

### 204. 2026-09-27, 20:42 UTC

> build the free companion. build a version of the free companion that we can change the brain to claude or openai models. the brain of the free ai companion that is. we wouldn't be paying $0.08 per minute or whatever but the brain could be smarter (Fable) or just much less money if the app is mostly listening.

**What was done:** Talk it over has a third way to talk, "Free voice (takes turns)" (`app/talk_turns.py`): the browser's own speech recognition listens (with a box to type instead where a browser can't), the chosen brain writes the reply with the same instructions, context and memory as the live companion plus a note that it will be heard, and a free Microsoft voice speaks it sentence by sentence, the next sentence recorded while one plays. Brains: the free Jetstream model for everyone (the default for free accounts, with no daily limit), and for premium accounts Claude Fable 5.1, Opus 5.5 and Haiku 4.5 through OpenRouter or OpenAI GPT-5.5 and GPT-5.4 mini directly; each reply is logged with its cost, and Claude's unchanging context is cached, so later replies cost about a tenth (Haiku: $0.009 then $0.0008). Tested: the free brain answers in 10 to 20 seconds, the paid ones in 1.5 to 6. Conversations are saved to history and memory like live ones. New endpoints `POST /api/talk/turn` and `/api/talk/speak`.

### 205. 2026-09-27, 20:44 UTC

> this is a bug, when I change one of these models planning the retreat the other one changes, I cant make them different *(with a screenshot of the two model menus)*

**What was done:** The two menus were tied together from when one model did both jobs. Now planning and writing each keep their own choice (the server already accepted separate models); tested with Haiku to plan and Fable to write.

### 206. 2026-09-27, 20:48 UTC

> add a "Save my defaults" button so that once I choose these voices when I make the next retreat I have these the same way *(with a screenshot of the Voices menus)*

**What was done:** "Save my defaults" (under the voices, and at the end of Advanced) saves every choice in Advanced (voices, models, research, the reflection's voice, prompts, guidance) to the account (`GET`/`PUT /api/profile/defaults`). Signing in on any device applies the saved defaults once whenever they're newer; changes after that stay on the device until saved again. Tested by wiping a browser's storage and seeing the saved voices come back.

### 207. 2026-09-27, 20:52 UTC

> generate a Google docs version of a retreat, create it using google docs, then have a "see example" link below the google doc which would open to a google doc example of a retreat. a short one, a long one, etc.

**What was done:** Created four example source documents as Google Docs in a Drive folder, "Ignatius at Home: example retreat documents", all public-domain World English Bible text: a short three-day handout (Called by Name), loose passages with no days (Rest and Return, for the app to plan), a five-day handout with graces and focus (Be Still), and a six-day longer handout (I Am). Each begins with a line on what it shows. New retreat now has "or use a Google Doc" (the server already read Google Docs; the page never had a place for the link) with "See an example" listing the four. The folder must be shared as "Anyone with the link can view" for the links, and for trying them in the app, to work; the Drive tools available can't set link sharing, so the owner does that once.

### 208. 2026-09-27, 20:55 UTC

> for this "sign in using your phone" with a QR code that gives instant access *(with a screenshot of the browser's sign-in code)*

**What was done:** The code box is now "Sign in on your phone", with a QR code beside the eight-digit code: a link to the app carrying the code, so scanning it with the phone's camera opens the app in the phone's browser and signs in at once (the code is then taken out of the address). A Home Screen app can't be opened by a link, so there the code is still typed. "On your phone" in the header opens it from any page on the laptop, as does About me. The QR library, qrcode-generator 2.0.4 (MIT), is served with the app; the rendered code was decoded to check it carries the right link.

### 209. 2026-09-27, 20:57 UTC

> give people an example of a "what i'm looking for in a conversation companion, link to a google doc public with some form of mine is pretty good *(followed by the author's own companion notes)*

**What was done:** Added the author's notes as a Google Doc in the same folder ("Example: What I'm looking for in the conversation companion", with a line saying to write one's own in one's own words), linked as "See an example" under that box on About me.

### 210. 2026-09-27, 21:05 UTC

> there should be a clear call to action on the home page, right now it is unreachable to go to the ai companion to talk, make it a simple one-push button on the iphone from the home page that says Talk Now and it pipes you into your spiritual director. spiritual directors / ai companion should know what time it is when the person pushed to talk, and they should know when their last conversation was. so it should go into the prompt as we prompt the companion / how do I access the prompts within the app? I want the code to be structured in such a way that the default prompts for all the LLM calls are stored in a 'agent prompts' or something folder so if we want to change the behavior of the agent like the book study person or heart talk or the live spirtual director I want one place or an easy index/guide in the readme to say how to edit the prompts and app behaviors / it looks weird in this diagram that retreats would be a public database

**What was done:**
- **Talk now.** A full-width "Talk now" button now sits at the top of the home page. One tap unlocks the phone's audio, opens Talk it over on today's retreat and starts the conversation. The companion's instructions already carried the local time when the person started ("Right now: It is Sunday… 9:12 pm… (in the evening)"). The last conversation is now given precisely too ("about 3 hours ago", "yesterday", "5 days ago"). Tried locally: the first reply came in two seconds, greeting the evening and picking up that morning's prayer.
- **Agent prompts in one folder.** Every prompt sent to a model now lives in [`app/agent_prompts/`](https://github.com/bcollier/ignatius-hw4-api/tree/main/app/agent_prompts), renamed from prompt_texts. The prompts that were still inside the code moved there too: the planner's format rules, the heart and deep-dive formats, the research notes, the spoken guidance lines, the retreat-so-far and series notes, About me condensing, the companion's memory, the turn-taking addendum, and the practice writer. A check showed every prompt the app sends is word for word the same as before.
- **The index.** The folder's README lists each agent: file, when it runs, what it's given, which model runs it, and where it can also be edited in the app. Both READMEs gained a "Changing how the agents behave" section.
- **The diagram.** It now says "Postgres table: retreats, private, row-level security, server key only". "public" was only the name of Postgres's default schema; no one can read the table without the server's key.

### 211. 2026-09-27, 21:12 UTC

> explain how this works, the jsonb is just a link to a json object with a bucket id *(with a screenshot of the data model diagram)*

**What was done:** Explained that the `data` jsonb column is the whole retreat, not a link. It holds the plan, days, scripts, status and costs. Each image and recording inside it carries a Storage `path` (`{user_id}/{retreat_id}/…`) in the one private bucket; no bucket id is stored. The API turns those paths into short-lived signed URLs when a retreat is opened. Deleting a retreat deletes the files by walking those paths (`storage.file_paths`), since Postgres has no link to Storage.

### 212. 2026-09-27, 21:16 UTC

> in the technical architecture I want slides or images diagrams clearly showing a screen of the app on one side or a feature-flow, and show the server that is behind that feature (data) and the models being used AI models

**What was done:** Seven slides, one per feature, in [docs/feature-flows](https://github.com/bcollier/ignatius-hw4-api/blob/main/docs/feature-flows/README.md), embedded in [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/bcollier/ignatius-hw4-api/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) under "Feature by feature". Each slide shows:
- **the screen:** a real iPhone screenshot on the left;
- **the server and data:** the FastAPI endpoints and modules on Render, and what they read and write in Supabase (table, bucket paths, llm_calls);
- **the models and services:** on the right, with the real model ids and whether each is free or paid;
- **the prompt files** it uses, in the footer.

The seven features: sign-in, new retreat, building a day, praying, Talk it over and Talk now, your own Examen, and a retreat from an idea. Each claim was checked against the code, and the slides are HTML rendered to PNG so they can be regenerated.

### 213. 2026-09-27, 21:18 UTC

> I think About Me should just be called Settings, and the top thing will be setting the About Me. settings could be more hidden at the bottom.

**What was done:** About me is now Settings, linked in small type at the bottom of every page, and the top menu is Practice and About. Settings opens with About me, then the account (sign out, sign in on your phone), then a "Show technical details" switch for build logs and costs, which replaces `?debug=true`.

### 214. 2026-09-27, 21:20 UTC

> *(the About page's research services text)* these should all have links to the sites where people can sign in and get a free API key for those services, actually a few links into the best documentation about how to setup those services yourself with an API key

**What was done:** Each research service on the About page shows its free allowance and four links: sign up for a key, getting started, the reference for the exact endpoint the app calls, and pricing. It also names the environment variable for the key. Both READMEs gained a "Set up the research services yourself" table with the same links. A subagent opened every link on September 27; three sign-in dashboards (Exa, Tavily, Linkup) load only in a browser, so only their addresses were confirmed.

### 215. 2026-09-27, 21:24 UTC

> i want to build a harness for running evals on all of these models. so I want to be able to compare claude 5.5 with OpenAI 6 or free service Muse, or best ollama model. have them all generate responses to the deep dives, and to the from the heart . they should be rated on a rubric for 1-7 scores on how good they were at being emotionally engaging, thoughtful, well-research, sounded like it had AI jargon in it, was too vague, said something a user may disagree with theoligically , was encouraging, rate it on how the response does from 1-7 by each fruit of the spirit that it demonstrates,. rate it 1-7 on how it conveys faith, hope, and love.

**What was done:** In progress. Contestants: Claude Opus 5.5, OpenAI GPT-6 Sol (GPT-6 on OpenRouter comes as Luna, Sol and Astra; Astra and Fable 5.1 can be added), Muse Glimmer (free) and Gemma 4 31B, the best general model that fits this Mac, running locally in Ollama 0.34.4 (installed from Ollama's official release into ~/.local, since Homebrew here belongs to another account). Every model gets exactly what the app sends: the same prompts, day context and shared web research. The rubric (19 scales, 1 to 7) is in `app/agent_prompts/eval_judge.md`, judged blind by two judges from different companies.

> on this page the book on the top left has a cool animation but the ones on the bottom don't animate the same way on hover, look into that , add the animation to all if possible *(with a screenshot of the library)*

**What was done:** The example covers' entrance animation used `fill-mode: both`, which kept `transform: none` after it ended and overrode the hover lift. Changed it to `backwards`; all covers now lift and tilt on hover (checked in a headless browser).

### 217. 2026-09-27, 21:33 UTC

> implement https://deepeval.com/blog/introducing-jev-in-deepeval. this for the ignatius systm , using evals I discussed and all reasonable evals

**What was done:** In progress. Read the post and the JevEval docs, installed DeepEval 4.2.6 and the TypeSafe SDK for the eval tools only (not the server), and built a DeepEval suite: JevEval Score and Noul questions for every rubric scale and yes/no checks, G-Eval, Faithfulness, Hallucination, Prompt alignment, Role adherence and Turn relevancy for the companion, and deterministic checks (length, spoken format, citing only the research, sentence length, naming 988). Jev needs a TypeSafe API key from the author.

### 218. 2026-09-27, 21:36 UTC

> this can be a separate eval systme from what you made, I want to use LLM as judge evals and then a comparison to a total DeepEval system

**What was done:** Split into system A (LLM as judge, `evals/llm_judge.py`) and system B (all DeepEval, `evals/deepeval_suite.py`), both scoring the same generated pieces and companion conversations (`evals/generate.py`), with `evals/compare.py` reporting each system and how far they agree (Spearman correlation per scale, model rankings). A smoke test ran end to end; G-Eval needs a judge model that returns log-probabilities, which GPT-6's reasoning models don't.

### 219. 2026-09-27, 21:41 UTC

> when complete build a slide deck and a whitepaper explaining AI evals, and explaining https://deepeval.com/blog/introducing-jev-in-deepeval and how it is the same or different than other eval systems for AI. compare them generally and then use this as an example for which evals for the models in this app is generating

**What was done:** Pending: to be written from the full eval run.

### 220. 2026-09-27, 21:48 UTC

> I just had a security audit ran using codex, go look at what it found and advise me jarvis@Mac-mini security-audit-2026-09-27 %

**What was done:** Read the audit (ten findings) and checked the key ones against the code and production. The example-log leak of conversations (F01) is real in code, but no conversations were attached to the examples yet; the storage bucket is private; `/api/options` shows the ElevenLabs balance publicly. Advised an order of fixes and asked before changing code.

### 221. 2026-09-27, 22:00 UTC

> *(two PDFs: a retreat worksheet, "Prayer Over My Dossier", and "Meditation on My Birth" by Dr. Eileen C. Burke-Sullivan)* build these into exercises you can do on the web app. guided through each of these with a free voice. build both entire features they could go in prayer practice

**What was done:** Two new guided sessions under Practice, written by Claude Opus 5.5 from summaries of the handouts (in the app's own words, credited) and recorded in the free Microsoft voice Ava, with no ElevenLabs credits used. "Prayer Over My Dossier" (about 40 minutes): the worksheet's facts one group at a time, with the fields shown as writing prompts, then the four sets of six traits, turning each into praise. "Meditation on My Birth" (about 25 minutes): imaginative prayer standing beside God at one's own birth, gentle about adoption and painful stories, a long colloquy, the Glory Be, and review questions, shown over Georges de La Tour's *The Newborn* (public domain). Answers save to the journal like the other practices.

### 222. 2026-09-27, 22:05 UTC

> put a turn on debug mode in the settings page

**What was done:** The Settings switch is now labeled "Debug mode" (it shows the build logs and costs), and turning it on or off also shows or hides the Debug badge in the header.

### 223. 2026-09-27, 22:15 UTC

> There needs to be a place in the app you can read the prompts for all of the agents in the app and edit them into a custom user prompt . For example you want your spiritual ai companion to have a different prompt. Or a different model altogether

**What was done:** A new Agents page (Settings → Agents, `?agents`) lists all ten agents: the planner, idea to passages, both heart voices, the deep dive, the spoken guidance, the companion, its turn-taking addendum, its memory, and your own Examen. Each shows what it does, when it runs, what it's given and its default file. You can read the full prompt, make your own version (saved to your account and used wherever that agent runs, for you only) and go back to the default. You can also choose a model: New retreat's planning and writing models, the companion's live voice or turn-taking brain, and the Examen's and the memory's model on the server. The fixed blocks (background, house style, format rules) are shown read only. New retreat starts from your versions, the Talk page shares the companion's, and one person's versions are cleared on sign-out. New `GET/PUT /api/agents`, `app/agents.py`, and 7 tests.

### 224. 2026-09-27, 22:30 UTC

> Have a section of the app that explains in detail the technical differences between how a voice like grok or the OpenAI live voice do voice to voice so you can interrupt them and they make small sounds that ar me human but not words. It is the most conversational. Of the natural language models but it won't have the model reasoning and tools of something like when you have a tts then model then stt pipeline of talking to an agent like Claude does

**What was done:** A new section on the About page, "How the companion talks: live voices and taking turns", linked from the Talk page ("How the voices differ"). It has a diagram of the two pipelines, then covers:
- why speech-to-speech feels human: it works on sound itself, streams both ways, hears tone, can say "mm", and voice-activity detection lets you interrupt;
- what it gives up: depth of thought, tools (none here), exact transcripts, and it's billed while quiet;
- what speech-to-text → model → text-to-speech does better and worse.
Links with an anchor now scroll to their section.

### 225. 2026-09-27, 22:58 UTC

> Build a detailed diagram of all the agents in this app and the tools available to that agent

**What was done:** A tall slide, [08-agents.png](https://github.com/bcollier/ignatius-hw4-api/blob/main/docs/feature-flows/08-agents.png), with every agent: its model and prompt file, what it's given, its tools and capabilities, and where its output goes. Twelve agents plus the eval judges. Only the deep dive calls a tool itself (Anthropic's `web_search`, Claude only). The others use structured output, image reading, or tools the app runs around them: the six search services, bible-api.com, speech recognition and the voices. Added to ARCHITECTURE.md, the agent prompts index and the Agents page.

### 226. 2026-09-27, 23:10 UTC

> why this ? G-Eval, judged by Grok 4.7:   and why only two System A (LLM as judge): the text above goes to two judges, Claude Opus 5.5 and GPT-6 Sol. we should at least also do the free models that we haev acccess to like jetstream. maybe also use either grok or gemini as the another evaluator.

**What was done:** Explained that G-Eval weights its score by the judge's token probabilities, which Claude and GPT-6's reasoning models don't return and Grok does, and that keeping Grok in system B keeps the two systems independent. System A now has five judges: Claude Opus 5.5, GPT-6 Sol, Gemini 3.8 Flash (Google's newest), and the free Muse Glimmer and Llama 4 Scout. The report adds a "no self-judging" view that leaves out each contestant's own model.

### 227. 2026-09-27, 23:25 UTC

> do a pass with the free / cheapest judges first, show the ratings and cross reliability. then if all looks good we will include OPUS and GPT6, do the deepeval with grok. what is it using for test data? sections that were already generated or specific test configurations?

**What was done:** Explained the test set: six fixed passages and three scripted conversations, written fresh by each contestant with the app's real prompts and shared research, not the author's own retreats. Wrote `evals/reliability.py`: Krippendorff's alpha per scale, each judge's leniency, spread and range, judge-against-judge correlations, and each judge's ranking of the contestants. In progress: the cheap-judge pass after generation finishes.

### 228. 2026-09-27, 23:35 UTC

> do those security fixes as well, is there anything else you are waiting on me for?

**What was done:** Fixed F01, F02, F05, F06, F07 and the public balance, with 10 new tests that assert the fixes hold. The audit's own draft reproduction now fails, which confirms the fix.
- **F01, conversation leak:** an example's log shows other people only its build steps, and talks are filed only under the person's own retreat.
- **F02, voice billing:** the server measures and charges call time; a call must be the person's own before it can be ended; OpenAI calls are hung up on end; unended calls are settled at the limit; one live call at a time; Grok is premium-only.
- **F05/F06, fail-closed start:** the server refuses to start half-configured, without sign-in unless `LOCAL_MODE=1`, or with a public bucket (production's bucket was checked first: it's private).
- **F07, journal drafts:** drafts are kept per account and cleared at sign-out.
Production came back up on the new code.

### 229. 2026-09-28, 01:40 UTC

> It should say estimated time it takes to do this exercise, in the future have multiple versions that are longer or shorter . Like a 10 minute examen *(with a screenshot of a practice session)*

**What was done:** Each practice session now shows "about 30 minutes" at the start and "… 29 left" as it goes, following the voice speed. Shorter and longer versions of each practice, like a 10-minute Examen, are written up as the next item in IMPROVEMENTS.md.

### 230. 2026-09-28, 01:50 UTC

> Give the option in settings to slow it down a bit. The voices sometime sound like they are going to fast

**What was done:** Settings → Listening → Voice speed: Slower, A little slower, Normal, A little faster. It applies to every recorded voice (readings, reflections, deep dives, practices, turn-taking replies) without changing pitch. Silences and bells keep their exact length, and live voices stream at their own pace. The choice is saved with "Save my defaults".

### 231. 2026-09-28, 02:05 UTC

> on your lifts faith story when I push pause the background sound is still there

**What was done:** Pause (on the page or the lock screen) now fades out and pauses the background music along with the voice, and Play brings back the same track where it stopped. This was true of every practice with music on, not only this one. Checked in a headless browser with the chant playing.

### 232. 2026-09-28, 02:15 UTC

> do this Evals: Opus, GPT-6 and Muse have finished writing. Gemma, on your Mac, needs about two more hours. The cheap judges (Gemini Flash, Muse, Llama Scout) are scoring the finished pieces now. When they're done I'll show you: * the ratings; * each judge's leniency; * the agreement numbers. / explain this Silence notice on live calls: yes or no? It's written up but not built. / go ahead with all security fixes of any size and scope / explain more details and step by step what you need for the only you can do these

**What was done:** Every remaining audit finding and observation fixed and deployed:
- **F10:** no side effects before an ownership check.
- **F08:** deleting a retreat or forgetting conversations removes the files and erases the log copies; the costs are kept.
- **F09:** sign-in codes use the caller's address as Render's edge saw it; no global lockout; one code per account.
- **F03:** limits on jobs at once and per day.
- **F04:** bodies capped before parsing; zip-bomb, image-size and page-size limits; Google Docs downloads streamed with a ceiling; parsing off the event loop.
- **Observations:**
  - sign-in cache hashed, expiring and bounded;
  - an empty allowlist now means no one gets full mode;
  - search queries are written without private notes;
  - signed links last 6 hours;
  - dependencies install from a hashed lock;
  - Dependabot opens update pull requests;
  - the web page has a Content Security Policy, refuses framing, and keeps tokens out of error reports.
145 backend tests pass, 23 of them security tests. A walk through the whole app under the new policy found no violations. Production confirmed live (an oversized body now gets 413).
Cheap-judge pass (Gemini Flash, Muse, Llama Scout) on 48 pieces and conversations: ratings, leniency and agreement (Krippendorff's alpha, also with each judge's leniency removed) in `evals/runs/full/reliability.md`. Agreement is weak. Explained the silence notice, and the owner's remaining steps one by one.

### 233. 2026-09-28, 02:20 UTC

> *(screenshots confirming ALLOWED_EMAILS and the build command on Render)* yes do this [the silence notice] … for evals I want a screen available when in debug mode that shows the distributions of scores on the evals run. use both statistic tables and strong visuals that would make me proud as a professors of data visualization. I want a deep analysis on whether these cheap/free evaluations are good, what their distributions are, cohens kappa, alpha, etc. and comparison to I want to see detailed data before we run the expensive evals I want just make sense all the categories and comparisons will give me meaningful data

**What was done:** The silence notice is live: "Still there?" after three quiet minutes on a live call, and the call ends a minute later unless you choose to keep talking. The Eval analysis page (debug mode: Settings, or the footer) has nine sections of hand-built SVG charts and tables, computed by `evals/analysis.py`:
- the short answer;
- how each judge uses the scale;
- every scale's distribution per judge;
- agreement: Krippendorff's alpha raw and with leniency removed, ICC(2,1) and ICC(2,k), and Cohen's quadratic-weighted kappa per scale;
- η² against a permutation-test chance level;
- model means with bootstrap intervals and pairwise differences;
- the scale correlation heatmap with the share of the first factor;
- power;
- every judgment.
Finding: the cheap judges aren't reliable on single scales. Most scores are 6 or 7, so kappa is near zero even where exact agreement is 90%. Some scales still separate the models.

### 234. 2026-09-28, 02:30 UTC

> needed feature, for the ai companion users should be able to do a text-only version. there should be a few options, fully live voice to voice, then the free voice to voice (with tts and sst), then one where the app talks outloud into your ear but you are typing (so you can remain quiet), and finally the standard text-to-text chat. it should all be stored as one continuous conversation, do reasonable technical things to manage the context length (like creating a summary) etc. but make sure all options are simple and available. build it now. when the text-to-text is processing the animation should be really cute or beautiful or something. maybe have a tiny animation where it goes back and highlights some keywords in the text you've typed with a highligher, something so the waiting for response is not so brutal. this feature does not work without an excellent animation, really spend the time on it, perhaps make 3-5 different designs for animations, and allow who-ever has "Debug on" to change the animation from one kind of animation to another in the settings screen. make a preview in the setttings screens of all the kinds of animations.

**What was done:** Talk it over now offers four ways to talk: live voice, the free voice, typing with a spoken reply, and text chat. You choose up front and can switch at any time; switching to or from the live voice continues the conversation as a new call. A conversation from the last twelve hours continues by default, saved as one record, with "Start a new conversation instead". Long conversations fold older turns into a running summary (a new agent prompt) and keep the full record. Typed modes have a composer, and five waiting animations, all previewed and chosen in Settings in debug mode:
- the highlighter, which marks key words in your message;
- the quill;
- the candle;
- still water;
- gold leaf.
Tested with a real conversation.

### 235. 2026-09-28, 02:32 UTC

> create a feature when the user is in Debug on to have the last security audit run on the code base to show all for example 45 things checked in hte audit, show when it was checked, and a red, yellow, green if there is an issue. the security audit page should be extensive, very visual (again I teach Data Visualization so it has to be good), develop a complete unit testing, integration testing, UX testing plan, and security testing and code analysis checks, and all of those should be visible on a testing and security report buried in the settings page for people with Debug on

**What was done:** In progress.

### 236. 2026-09-28, 02:35 UTC

> for evals we should keep the results of EVERY run, so we can compare test-retest validity. the evals section should have a section for reliability measures, validity measures, and generalizability measures. make it extensive. always save historic data for comparison when new evals are run

**What was done:** In progress.

### 237. 2026-09-28, 02:40 UTC

> the ai companion should know when the user switches to voice, or text-to-text, or when the ai is speaking outloud. it may help with context.

**What was done:** Each turn carries its mode. The companion gets matching guidance: spoken, typed with a spoken reply, or written (two new agent prompts). A note like "[They've switched to typing; your replies are now spoken aloud to them]" goes into the conversation where the switch happened. Tested.

### 238. 2026-09-28, 02:50 UTC

> label the graph itself with this information pointing to what is perfect agreement, etc Hollow circle: … a filled circle near zero means they don't even order the pieces alike.

**What was done:** The agreement chart now labels itself:
- arrows to "1 = perfect agreement", "0 = no better than chance" and "below 0 = systematic disagreement";
- shaded bands for tentative and reliable;
- callouts naming each marker on the first row;
- a header for the right column;
- a "How to read a row" strip with the two patterns drawn.

### 239. 2026-09-28, 02:55 UTC

> i like this one, i wnat to be able to see the raw question/response in a hover or something and are teh stength and weakness does each model give text for strength weakness? do they agree in text about the strenght and weakness? *(with a screenshot of the judgments table)*

**What was done:** Yes: every judge writes a strength and a weakness for every piece. "Every piece" now groups the judges side by side, marks words two or more of them used, and shows how much their words overlap. Strengths overlap by about 5% on average and weaknesses by 4%, though they often make the same point in different words. Opening a piece shows exactly what the model was given and what it wrote, or the whole conversation.

### 240. 2026-09-28, 03:00 UTC

> look at the distribution of the raw scores, it seems we need more scale variability consider ways we could have a more "bell curve" like evaluation, develop several alternative scales, compare them using the free/cheap models, and give me a report on which scales have the best statistical properties on the cheap/free models. what changes in the scale were the most effective?

**What was done:** Started a scale study (evals/scale_study.py) comparing seven alternative formats with the cheap judges: behaviourally anchored 1–7, a 0–10 scale, a checklist, critique-then-score, exemplar-anchored, pairwise and ranking. The results and report follow when collection finishes.

### 241. 2026-09-28, 03:10 UTC

> you just used my scale, I like these evluations but add some that are more scientific or helpful for truly evaluating which model would be best for this application and at what cost

**What was done:** Added evals/fitness.py and a "Which model for this app, at what cost?" section. It checks the pieces directly: scripture fidelity, grounding in the research, instructions followed, writing for the ear, the companion's behaviour, reliability, speed and cost. It adds a Pareto frontier and a weighting sensitivity study (docs/evals/FITNESS.md). Muse Glimmer is the only model on the cost-and-fitness frontier. GPT-6 Sol costs about a sixth of what Opus does. Gemma cites sources outside its research.

### 242. 2026-09-28, 03:15 UTC

> when hovering over the text like "too vague" it should list the entire question and the scale that was used in the tooltip

**What was done:** Every scale name on the evals page now shows a tooltip with the full question the judges were asked and the 1–7 anchors.

### 243. 2026-09-28, 03:20 UTC

> what about other measures of agreement? cohen's quadratic weighted kappa or something?

**What was done:** Added quadratic-weighted Cohen's kappa (the mean of each judge pair, per scale), Gwet's AC2 and ICC(2,1)/ICC(2,k). Pooling kappa across scales was misleading, so it is computed per scale. The scores show the kappa paradox: kappa is near 0 while AC2 is 0.95 or more. The judges agree, but nearly every score is 6 or 7, so the scale can't tell pieces apart.

### 244. 2026-09-28, 03:25 UTC

> when hovering over john20 in Every judgement it should say what the passage is, should be easy to get to other measures besides overall

**What was done:** Passage ids now show the reference and its opening words on hover. "Every piece" can show all the scales, and the models chart has a measure picker covering overall and each scale.

### 245. 2026-09-28, 03:35 UTC

> we should clearly indicate what a good value is here with annotations the red line is good, or by chance, or what, be explicity with annoations to interpret graphs

**What was done:** Every eval chart now says what a good value looks like:
- The η² chart points to what luck alone gives and labels the 0 and 1 ends, with a "How to read a bar" key.
- The models chart has callouts, a "better →" label and labels for which model is better.
- The judge-usage bars mark the critical and generous ends.
- The correlation heatmap has a reading key and a legend saying which values are good or redundant.
- The cost plots mark the "better" corner and the frontier.
- The weighting plot shows which way is better.
- The power table has a legend.

### 246. 2026-09-28, 03:10 UTC

> I don't like this screenshot it doesn't show the app well  its on my portfolio *(with a screenshot of the Ignatius at Home card on the projects page)*

**What was done:** The card crops its image to a tall frame beside the text, so the old wide spread showed only the edge of the painting. Made a portrait image (1200×1600) of three real iPhone screens: the home page, the prayer player and the retreat page. Also updated the alt text and opened a pull request on the site (bcollier/ben.collier.phd#16), held for approval before merging.

### 247. 2026-09-28, 03:20 UTC

> merge it

**What was done:** Squash-merged bcollier/ben.collier.phd#16. The new Ignatius at Home image is live on the projects page.

### 248. 2026-09-28, 13:10 UTC

> Still running?

**What was done:** Yes, it had finished: 1,377 judgments, none invalid, about $1.64. My watcher had missed the finish because it matched its own command line. Ran the analysis and committed the study: evals/scale_study.py, seven eval_scale_*.md prompts and docs/evals/SCALE_STUDY.md. Added a "Would another way of asking work better?" section to the evals page, with each format's score histogram and cells shaded good, fair or poor on stated cut-offs. The finding: comparing pieces pairwise did far more than rewording a scale. The judges' agreement rose from α −0.26 to 0.49, and the models separated best. Critique-first cut the top-end pile-up most (79% to 45%). The checklist and the 0–10 scale didn't help.

### 249. 2026-09-28, 13:30 UTC

> immediately after a user uploads a PDF it should come up with a 2-3 sentence description and title for the retreat to confirm the user has the right file rather than P1W3P.pdf or whatever the file is called

**What was done:** Choosing a file on New retreat now shows "Reading it to see what it is". A second or two later, the file name is replaced by the document's title and a 2–3 sentence description of what it contains, with the file name, page count and "Not the right file? Choose another" in small print. It uses the new POST /api/retreats/preview (app/preview.py and the agent prompt preview.md, listed on the Agents page as "The first look"). It reads the start of the file, or the first page of a scan or photo, with the fast model from the family chosen for planning: Llama 4 Scout (free) or Claude Haiku 4.5. Nothing is stored; it's limited to 20 per account per 10 minutes, and if it fails the file name simply stays. Two tests added; 152 pass.

### 250. 2026-09-28, 14:05 UTC

> instead of "Tap to talk" can we have it listen and determine? the way claude conversations work?

**What was done:** The free voice is now hands-free, like a voice conversation with Claude. After the companion speaks, the app listens. It answers when you pause: about 2 seconds, longer after just a word or two or after "and…" or "um…". If the browser stops listening during a long silence, it starts again. The one button pauses listening, sends at once, or interrupts the companion while it speaks. Settings → Listening chooses between hands-free and tap to talk, and how long a pause ends your turn (short, normal, long). Tested in the browser with a stand-in speech recognizer and the real free brain and voice: it listened after the greeting, sent 2 seconds after the last word, and listened again after the reply.

### 251. 2026-09-28, 14:10 UTC

> this is wonky *(with a screenshot of the Talk page in text mode: a large empty gap above the conversation, and four "You're typing/talking now" notes in a row)*

**What was done:** Fixed both. When typing, the empty voice-button area now hides completely, which removes the gap. Switching modes again before anything is said updates the one note instead of adding another.

### 252. 2026-09-28, 14:15 UTC

> add the youtube video to the readme file, make the thumbnail nice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpS1dclAo4w  this is the description video

**What was done:** Added the description video to the top of both READMEs. It shows as a thumbnail made from the video's own frame with a play button and a caption, linked to YouTube.

---

*End of the log. The original design came from an earlier, separate session (September 24–25; see [docs/original-spec](https://github.com/bcollier/ignatius-hw4-api/tree/main/docs/original-spec)); every change made to these two repositories after it came from one of the prompts above. Account settings the author changed by hand, such as the Supabase email settings, are described where they came up.*

## Prompts the app sends to models

The defaults are plain-text files in `app/agent_prompts/` (its README is the index), and most are shown, editable, under Advanced on the web page. Every call starts with a background on the Spiritual Exercises, retreats and lectio divina, and the person's About me notes.

- **Planning:** decide whether the material already has days or needs a composed arc; copy passages word for word; choose a grace, a focus and images for each day. Constrained to a JSON schema.
- **For the heart:** a spiritual companion, or the voice of Jesus in Ignatian imaginative prayer, in a house style written for listening.
- **Deep dive:** setting, original-language words, how the church has read the text, and real interpretive questions, written knowing what the heart reflection said. Claude models search the web themselves; open models are given what the research services found.
- **Spoken guidance:** default lines (ask for the grace, the four readings, the silence, the colloquy), tailored to the day's reflection and deep dive.
- **Talk it over:** a prayer companion modeled on how spiritual directors listen (mostly questions, little advice, noticing where God is at work), which says plainly that it is not a spiritual director.
